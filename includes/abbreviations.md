*[dataset]: A set of neuroimaging and behavioral data acquired for a purpose of a particular study. A dataset consists of data acquired from one or more subjects, possibly from multiple sessions.
*[derivatives]: Derivatives are outputs of common processing pipelines, capturing data and meta-data sufficient for a researcher to understand and (critically) reuse those outputs in subsequent processing.
*[entity]: An "entity" is an attribute that can be associated with a file, contributing to the identification of that file as a component of its filename in the form of a hyphen-separated key-value pair.
*[event] Something that happens or may be perceived by a test subject as happening at a particular instant during the recording.
*[run]: An uninterrupted repetition of data acquisition that has the same acquisition parameters and task (however events can change from run to run due to different subject response or randomized nature of the stimuli). Run is a synonym of a data acquisition.
*[sample]: A sample pertaining to a subject such as tissue, primary cell or cell-free sample.
*[session]: A logical grouping of neuroimaging and behavioral data consistent across subjects. Session can (but doesn't have to) be synonymous to a visit in a longitudinal study.
*[subject]: A person or animal participating in the study. Used interchangeably with term Participant.
*[suffix]: An alphanumeric string that forms part of a filename, located after all entities and following a final `_`, right before the file extension.
*[task]: A set of structured activities performed by the participant.
