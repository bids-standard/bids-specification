# Appendix VIII: Preferred Names of Coordinate Systems

To interpret a coordinate (x, y, z), it is required that you know relative to
which origin the coordinates are expressed, you have to know the interpretation
of the three axes, and you have to know the units in which the numbers are
expressed. This information is sometimes called the coordinate system.

These letters help describe the coordinate system definition:

-   A/P means anterior/posterior
-   L/R means left/right
-   S/I means superior/inferior

For example: `RAS` means that the first dimension (X) points towards the right
hand side of the head, the second dimension (Y) points towards the Anterior
aspect of the head, and the third dimension (Z) points towards the top of the
head.

Besides coordinate systems, defined by their origin and direction of the axes,
BIDS defines "spaces" as an artificial frame of reference, created to describe
different anatomies in a unifying manner (see e.g.,
[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.01.024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912000419?via%3Dihub)).
The "space" and all coordinates expressed in this space are by design a
transformation of the real world geometry, and nearly always different from the
individual subject space that it stems from. An example is the
Talairach-Tournoux space, which is constructed by piecewise linear scaling of an
individual's brain to that of the Talairach-Tournoux 1988 atlas. In the
Talairach-Tournoux space, the origin of the coordinate system is at the AC and
units are expressed in mm.

The coordinate systems below all relate to neuroscience and therefore to the
head or brain coordinates. Please be aware that all data acquisition starts with
"device coordinates" (scanner), which does not have to be identical to the
initial "file format coordinates" (DICOM), which are again different from the
"head" coordinates (e.g., NIFTI). Not only do device coordinate vary between
hardware manufacturers, but also the head coordinates differ, mostly due to
different conventions used in specific software packages developed by different
(commercial or academic) groups.

## Coordinate Systems applicable to MEG, EEG, and iEEG

Generally, across the MEG, EEG, and iEEG modalities, the first two pieces of
information (origin, orientation) are specified in `XXXCoordinateSystem`, and
the units are specified in `XXXCoordinateSystemUnits`.

Allowed values for the `XXXCoordinateSystem` field come from a list of
restricted keywords, as listed in the sections below. If no value from the
list of restricted keywords fits, there is always the option to specify the
value as follows:

-   `Other`: Use this for other coordinate systems and specify further details
    in the `XXXCoordinateSystemDescription` field

## MEG Specific Coordinate Systems

Restricted keywords for the `XXXCoordinateSystem` field in the
`coordinatesystem.json` file for MEG datasets:

-   `CTF`: ALS orientation and the origin between the ears
-   `ElektaNeuromag`: RAS orientation and the origin between the ears
-   `4DBti`: ALS orientation and the origin between the ears
-   `KitYokogawa`: ALS orientation and the origin between the ears
-   `ChietiItab`: RAS orientation and the origin between the ears

Note that the short descriptions above do not capture all details, There are
detailed extensive descriptions of these EEG coordinate systems on the
[FieldTrip toolbox web page](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/how_are_the_different_head_and_mri_coordinate_systems_defined)

## EEG Specific Coordinate Systems

Restricted keywords for the `XXXCoordinateSystem` field in the
`coordsystem.json` file for EEG datasets:

-   `BESA`: Although natively this is a spherical coordinate system, the
    electrode positions should be expressed in Cartesian coordinates, with a RAS
    orientation. The X axis is the T8-T7 line, positive at T8. The Y axis is the
    Oz-Fpz line, positive at Fpz. The origin of the sphere fitted to the
    electrodes is approximately 4 cm above the point between the ears.

-   `Captrak`: RAS orientation and the origin between the ears

Note that the short descriptions above do not capture all details, There are
detailed extensive descriptions of these EEG coordinate systems on the
[FieldTrip toolbox web page](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/how_are_the_different_head_and_mri_coordinate_systems_defined)
and on the [BESA wiki](http://wiki.besa.de/index.php?title=Electrodes_and_Surface_Locations#Coordinate_systems).

## iEEG Specific Coordinate Systems

Restricted keywords for the `XXXCoordinateSystem` field in the
`coordsystem.json` file for iEEG datasets:

-   `Pixels`: If electrodes are localized in 2D space (only x and y are
    specified and z is n/a), then the positions in this file must correspond to
    the locations expressed in pixels on the photo/drawing/rendering of the
    electrodes on the brain. In this case, coordinates must be (row,column)
    pairs, with (0,0) corresponding to the upper left pixel and (N,0)
    corresponding to the lower left pixel.

-   `ACPC`: The origin of the coordinate system is at the Anterior Commissure
    and the negative y-axis is passing through the Posterior Commissure. The
    positive z-axis is passing through a mid-hemispheric point in the superior
    direction. The anatomical landmarks are determined in the individual's
    anatomical scan and no scaling or deformations have been applied to the
    individual's anatomical scan. For more information, see the [ACPC site](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/acpc/)
    on the FieldTrip toolbox wiki.

## Template Based Coordinate Systems

The transformation of the real world geometry to an artificial frame of
reference is described in `XXXCoordinateSystem`. Unless otherwise specified
below, the origin is at the AC and the orientation of the axes is RAS. Unless
specified explicitly in the sidecar file in the `XXCoordinateSystemUnits` field,
the units are assumed to be mm.
