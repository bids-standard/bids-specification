# Appendix IX: Entities

This section compiles the entities (key-value pairs) described throughout this
specification, and describes each.

A general introduction to entities is given in the section on
[file name structure](../02-common-principles.md#file-name-structure).

The ordering of entities and whether it is allowed, OPTIONAL, or REQUIRED for
each is given in the [Entity Table](04-entity-table.md).
