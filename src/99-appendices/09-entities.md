# Appendix IX: Entities

This section compiles the entities (key-value pairs) described throughout this
specification, and describes each.

A general introduction to entities is given in the section on
[filename structure](../02-common-principles.md#file-name-structure).

The ordering of entities, and whether each is OPTIONAL, REQUIRED, or MUST NOT
be specified for a given file type, is specified in the [Entity Table](04-entity-table.md).
