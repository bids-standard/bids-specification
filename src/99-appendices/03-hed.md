# Appendix III: Hierarchical Event Descriptors

Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED) are a controlled vocabulary of terms describing events in a behavioral
paradigm. HED was originally developed with EEG in mind, but is applicable to
all behavioral experiments. Each level of a hierarchical tag is delimited with
a forward slash (`/`). A HED string contains one or more HED tags separated by
commas (`,`). Parentheses (brackets, `()`) group tags and enable specification
of multiple items and their attributes in a single HED string (see section 2.4
in [HED Tagging Strategy Guide](http://www.hedtags.org/downloads/HED%20Tagging%20Strategy%20Guide.pdf)).
For more information about HED and tools available to validate and match HED
strings, please visit [www.hedtags.org](http://www.hedtags.org). Since
dedicated fields already exist for the overall task classification in the
sidecar JSON files (`CogAtlasID` and `CogPOID`), HED tags from the `Paradigm`
HED subcategory should not be used to annotate events.

There are several ways to associate HED annotations with events within the BIDS
framework. The most direct way is to use the `HED` column of the `*_events.tsv`
file to annotate events:  

Example:

```Text
onset	duration	HED
1.1	n/a	Event/Category/Experimental stimulus, Event/Label/CrossFix,  Sensory presentation/Visual, Item/Object/2D Shape/Cross
1.3	n/a	Event/Category/Participant response, Event/Label/ButtonPress, Action/Button press
...
```

The direct approach requires that each line in the events file be
annotated. Since there are typically thousands of events in each experiment,
this method of annotation is usually not convenient unless the annotations are
automatically generated. In many experiments, the event instances fall into a
much smaller number of categories, and often these categories are labeled with
numerical codes or short names. It is therefore more convenient to associate
the HED annotations with these categories and allow the analysis tools to make
the association with individual event instances during analysis. To use this
approach, your `*_events.tsv` file should associate a category (often called an
event code) with each event instance. Since BIDS allows an arbitrary number of
columns to be included in an `*_events.tsv` file, you can make this association
by including columns representing various types of event categories in your
`*_events.tsv` file.

Example:

```Text
onset	duration	mycodes
1.1	n/a	Fixation
1.3	n/a	Button
1.8	n/a	Target
...

```
 
The tags in the `HED` column of the `*_events.tsv` file are often specific to the individual event instances,
while the common properties are represented by categorical values appearing in other columns.
You may provide a `HED` column and multiple categorical columns to document your events.
Each of these categorical columns should be documented in a corresponding `*_events.json` sidecar. 
The column name (e.g., `mycodes`) is the dictionary key to this documentation, as illustrated by the following example.  

Example:

```JSON
{
   "mycodes": {
       "LongName": "Local event type names",
       "Description": "Main types of events that comprise a trial",
       "Levels": {
          "Fixation": "Fixation cross is displayed",
          "Target":   "Target image appears",
          "Button":   "Subject presses a button"
       },	  
       "HED": {
           "Fixation": "Event/Category/Experimental stimulus, Event/Label/CrossFix,
		       Event/Description/A cross appears at screen center to serve as a fixation point,
		       Sensory presentation/Visual, Item/Object/2D Shape/Cross,
		       Attribute/Visual/Fixation point, Attribute/Visual/Rendering type/Screen,
		       Attribute/Location/Screen/Center",
           "Target":   "Event/Label/TargetImage, Event/Category/Experimental stimulus,
		       Event/Description/A white airplane as the RSVP target superimposed on a satellite image is displayed.,
		       Item/Object/Vehicle/Aircraft/Airplane, Participant/Effect/Cognitive/Target,
		       Sensory presentation/Visual/Rendering type/Screen/2D),
		       (Item/Natural scene/Arial/Satellite,
		       Sensory presentation/Visual/Rendering type/Screen/2D)",
           "Button":   "Event/Category/Participant response, Event/Label/PressButton, 
		       Event/Description/The participant presses the button as soon as the target is visible,
		       Action/Button press"
        }
   }
}
```
Downstream tools should not distinguish between tags specified using the explicit HED column and 
the categorical specifications, but should form the union before analysis.
Further, the [inheritance principle](../02-common-principles.md#the-inheritance-principle) applies,
so the data dictionaries can appear higher in the BIDS hierarchy.  

The HED vocabulary is specified by a HED schema, which delineates the allowed 
HED path strings. By default, BIDS uses the latest HED schema available in the
[hed-specification](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-specification/tree/master/hedxml) repository
maintained by the hed-standard group. 

You can override the default by providing a specific HED version number in the 
`dataset_description.json` file using the `HEDVersion` field. 
The preferred approach is to validate with the latest version (the default), 
but to use the `HEDVersion` field to specify which version was used for later reference.  

Example: The following `dataset_description.json` file specifies that 
`HED7.1.1.xml` from the [hed-specification](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-specification/tree/master/hedxml) repository
should be used to validate the study event annotations.

```JSON
{
  "Name": "The mother of all experiments",
  "BIDSVersion": "1.4.0",
  "HEDVersion": "7.1.1"
}
```
