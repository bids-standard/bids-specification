# Appendix III: Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) Tags

HED is a controlled vocabulary of terms describing events in a behavioral
paradigm. HED was originally developed with EEG in mind, but is applicable to
all behavioral experiments. Each level of a hierarchical tag is delimited with
a forward slash (`/`). An HED string contains one or more HED tags separated by
commas (`,`). Parentheses (brackets, `()`) group tags and enable specification
of multiple items and their attributes in a single HED string (see section 2.4
in [HED Tagging Strategy Guide](http://www.hedtags.org/downloads/HED%20Tagging%20Strategy%20Guide.pdf)).
For more information about HED and tools available to validate and match HED
strings, please visit [www.hedtags.org](http://www.hedtags.org). Since
dedicated fields already exist for the overall task classification in the
sidecar JSON files (`CogAtlasID` and `CogPOID`), HED tags from the `Paradigm`
HED subcategory should not be used to annotate events.

There are several ways to associate HED annotations with events within the BIDS
framework. The most direct way is to use the `HED` column of the \_events.tsv
file to annotate events:  

Example:

```Text
onset	duration	HED
1.1	n/a	Event/Category/Experimental stimulus, Event/Label/CrossFix,  Sensory presentation/Visual, Item/Object/2D Shape/Cross
1.3	n/a	Event/Category/Participant response, Event/Label/ButtonPress, Action/Button press
...
```

The direct approach requires that each line in the events file must be
annotated. Since there are typically thousands of events in each experiment,
this method of annotation is usually not convenient unless the annotations are
automatically generated. In many experiments, the event instances fall into a
much smaller number of categories, and often these categories are labeled with
numerical codes or short names. It is therefore more convenient to associate
the HED annotations with these categories and allow the analysis tools to make
the association with individual event instances during analysis. To use this
approach, your \_events.tsv file should associate a category (often called an
event code) with each event instance. Since BIDS allows an arbitrary number of
columns to be included in an \_events.tsv file, you can make this association
by including columns representing various types of event categories in your
\_events.tsv file.

Example:

```Text
onset	duration	mycodes
1.1	n/a	Fixation  
1.3	n/a	Button
1.8	n/a	Target
...

```

If you provide an \_events.json file somewhere in your data hierarchy that has
an HED mapping for `mycodes`, the HED tags associated with a given `mycodes`
value can then be associated with the event instances in that category. You
may provide a `HED` column and multiple category columns. The union of the
relevant HED tags will then be associated with the event instance.

Example:

```JSON
{
    "mycodes": {
        "HED": {
            "Fixation": "Event/Category/Experimental stimulus, Event/Label/CrossFix, Event/Description/A cross appears at screen center to serve as a fixation point, Sensory presentation/Visual, Item/Object/2D Shape/Cross, Attribute/Visual/Fixation point, Attribute/Visual/Rendering type/Screen, Attribute/Location/Screen/Center",
            "Target": "Event/Label/Target image, Event/Description/A white airplane as the RSVP target superimposed on a satellite image is displayed., Event/Category/Experimental stimulus, (Item/Object/Vehicle/Aircraft/Airplane, Participant/Effect/Cognitive/Target, Sensory presentation/Visual/Rendering type/Screen/2D), (Item/Natural scene/Arial/Satellite, Sensory presentation/Visual/Rendering type/Screen/2D)",
            "Button": "..."
        }
    }
}
```

The tags in the `HED` column are often specific to the event instances, while
the common properties associated with categories such as `mycodes` are
encapsulated in the \_events.json dictionary. Downstream tools should not
distinguish between tags specified using the different mechanisms. Further,
the normal BIDS inheritance principle applies so these data dictionaries can
appear higher in the BIDS hierarchy.
