# Appendix X: File collections

To give context to the use of [entity-linked file collections](../02-common-principles.md#file-name-structure),
applications concerned with this common principle are listed by descriptive tables
under their respective modalities.

Note that the tables in this appendix catalog applications where the use of
a file collection is REQUIRED.

Certain entitites interlink the files in a file collection through a metadata field.
Unlike other common entities (for example `run`), they require an iteration over different
values of the metadata fields they represent.
Please keep the following list of linking entities up-to-date with the file collections
included in this appendix:

* Magnetic Resonance Imaging
    * [`echo`](./09-entities.md#echo)
    * [`flip`](./09-entities.md#flip)
    * [`inv`](./09-entities.md#inv)
    * [`mt`](./09-entities.md#mt)
    * [`part`](./09-entities.md#part)
