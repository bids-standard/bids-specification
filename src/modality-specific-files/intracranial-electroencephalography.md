# Intracranial Electroencephalography

Support for Intracranial Electroencephalography (iEEG) was developed as a
[BIDS Extension Proposal](../extensions.md#bids-extension-proposals).
Please see [Citing BIDS](../introduction.md#citing-bids)
on how to appropriately credit this extension when referring to it in the
context of the academic literature.

Several [example iEEG datasets](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-examples/#ieeg)
have been formatted using this specification
and can be used for practical guidance when curating a new dataset.

}}

The iEEG community uses a variety of formats for storing raw data, and there is
no single standard that all researchers agree on. For BIDS, iEEG data MUST be
stored in one of the following formats:

| **Format**                                                                | **Extension(s)**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [European data format](https://www.edfplus.info/)                         | `.edf`                   | Each recording consists of a `.edf` single file. [`edf+`](https://www.edfplus.info/specs/edfplus.html) files are permitted. The capital `.EDF` extension MUST NOT be used. |
| [BrainVision Core Data Format][bvformat]                                  | `.vhdr`, `.vmrk`, `.eeg` | Each recording consists of a  `.vhdr`, `.vmrk`, `.eeg` file triplet.                                                                                                       |
| [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php)                          | `.set`, `.fdt`           | The format used by the MATLAB toolbox [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php). Each recording consists of a `.set` file with an OPTIONAL `.fdt` file.             |
| [Neurodata Without Borders](https://nwb-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | `.nwb`                   | Each recording consists of a single `.nwb` file.                                                                                                                           |
| [MEF3](https://osf.io/e3sf9/)                                             | `.mefd`                  | Each recording consists of a `.mefd` directory.                                                                                                                            |

It is RECOMMENDED to use the European data format, or the BrainVision data
format. It is furthermore discouraged to use the other accepted formats over
these RECOMMENDED formats, particularly because there are conversion scripts
available in most commonly used programming languages to convert data into the
RECOMMENDED formats.

Future versions of BIDS may extend this list of supported file formats. File
formats for future consideration MUST have open access documentation, MUST have
open source implementation for both reading and writing in at least two
programming languages and SHOULD be widely supported in multiple software
packages. Other formats that may be considered in the future should have a clear
added advantage over the existing formats and should have wide adoption in the
BIDS community.

The data format in which the data was originally stored is especially valuable
in case conversion elicits the loss of crucial metadata specific to
manufacturers and specific iEEG systems. We also encourage users to provide
additional meta information extracted from the manufacturer-specific data files
in the sidecar JSON file. Other relevant files MAY be included alongside the
original iEEG data in the [`/sourcedata` directory](../common-principles.md#source-vs-raw-vs-derived-data).

Note the RecordingType, which depends on whether the data stream on disk is interrupted or not.
Continuous data is by definition 1 segment without interruption.
Epoched data consists of multiple segments that all have the same length
(for example, corresponding to trials) and that have gaps in between.
Discontinuous data consists of multiple segments of different length,
for example due to a pause in the acquisition.

### Terminology: Electrodes vs. Channels

For proper documentation of iEEG recording metadata it is important to
understand the difference between electrode and channel: an iEEG electrode
is placed on or in the brain, whereas a channel is the combination of the analog
differential amplifier and analog-to-digital converter that result in a
potential (voltage) difference that is stored in the iEEG dataset. We employ the
following short definitions:

-   Electrode = A single point of contact between the acquisition system and the
    recording site (for example, scalp, neural tissue, ...). Multiple electrodes can be
    organized as arrays, grids, leads, strips, probes, shafts, caps (for EEG),
    and so forth.

-   Channel = A single analog-to-digital converter in the recording system that
    regularly samples the value of a transducer, which results in the signal
    being represented as a time series in the digitized data. This can be
    connected to two electrodes (to measure the potential difference between
    them), a magnetic field or magnetic gradient sensor, temperature sensor,
    accelerometer, and so forth.

Although the _reference_ and _ground_ electrodes are often referred to as
channels, they are in most common iEEG systems not recorded by themselves.
Therefore they are not represented as channels in the data. The type of
referencing for all channels and optionally the location of the reference
electrode and the location of the ground electrode MAY be specified.

### Sidecar JSON (`*_ieeg.json`)

For consistency between studies and institutions,
we encourage users to extract the values of metadata fields from the actual raw data.
Whenever possible, please avoid using ad hoc wording.

Those fields MUST be present:

<!-- This block generates a metadata table.

{{ MACROS___make_filename_template("raw", datatypes=["ieeg"], suffixes=["channels"]) }}

A channel represents one time series recorded with the recording system
(for example, there can be a bipolar channel, recorded from two electrodes or contact points on the tissue).
Although this information can often be extracted from the iEEG recording,
listing it in a simple `.tsv` document makes it easy to browse or search
(for example, searching for recordings with a sampling frequency of >=1000 Hz).
Hence, the `channels.tsv` file is RECOMMENDED.
Channels SHOULD appear in the table in the same order they do in the iEEG data file.
Any number of additional columns MAY be provided to provide additional information about the channels.
Note that electrode positions SHOULD NOT be added to this file but to `*_electrodes.tsv`.

The columns of the channels description table stored in `*_channels.tsv` are:

-->
{{ MACROS___make_filename_template("raw", datatypes=["ieeg"], suffixes=["electrodes"]) }}

File that gives the location, size and other properties of iEEG electrodes. Note
that coordinates are expected in cartesian coordinates according to the
`iEEGCoordinateSystem` and `iEEGCoordinateUnits` fields in
`*_coordsystem.json`. If an `*_electrodes.tsv` file is specified, a
`*_coordsystem.json` file MUST be specified as well.

The optional [`space-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#space) entity (`*[_space-<label>]_electrodes.tsv`) can be used to
indicate the way in which electrode positions are interpreted.
The space `<label>` MUST be taken from one of the modality specific lists in
the [Coordinate Systems Appendix](../appendices/coordinate-systems.md).
For example for iEEG data, the restricted keywords listed under
[iEEG Specific Coordinate Systems](../appendices/coordinate-systems.md#ieeg-specific-coordinate-systems)
are acceptable for `<label>`.

For examples:

-   `*_space-MNI152Lin` (electrodes are coregistred and scaled to a specific MNI
    template)

-   `*_space-Talairach` (electrodes are coregistred and scaled to Talairach
    space)

When referring to the `*_electrodes.tsv` file in a certain _space_ as defined
above, the [`space-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#space) of the accompanying `*_coordsystem.json` MUST
correspond.

For example:

<!-- This block generates a file tree.

      "sub-01_space-Talairach_coordsystem.json": "",
      "...": "",
      },
   }
) }}

The order of the required columns in the `*_electrodes.tsv` file MUST be as listed below.
The `x`, `y`, and `z` columns indicate the positions of the center of each electrode in Cartesian coordinates.
Units are specified in `space-<label>_coordsystem.json`.

### Recommended 3D coordinate systems

It is preferred that electrodes are localized in a 3D coordinate system (with
respect to a pre- and/or post-operative anatomical MRI or CT scans or in a
standard space as specified in the BIDS [Coordinate Systems Appendix](../appendices/coordinate-systems.md)
about preferred names of coordinate systems, such as ACPC).

### Allowed 2D coordinate systems

If electrodes are localized in 2D space (only x and y are specified and z is `"n/a"`),
then the positions in this file MUST correspond to the locations expressed
in pixels on the photo/drawing/rendering of the electrodes on the brain.
In this case, `iEEGCoordinateSystem` MUST be defined as `"Pixels"`,
and `iEEGCoordinateUnits` MUST be defined as `"pixels"`
(note the difference in capitalization).
Furthermore, the coordinates MUST be (row,column) pairs,
with (0,0) corresponding to the upper left pixel and (N,0) corresponding to the lower left pixel.

### Multiple coordinate systems

If electrode positions are known in multiple coordinate systems (for example, MRI, CT
and MNI), these spaces can be distinguished by the optional [`space-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#space)
field, see the [`*_electrodes.tsv`-section](#electrode-description-_electrodestsv)
for more information.
Note that the [`space-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#space) fields must correspond
between `*_electrodes.tsv` and `*_coordsystem.json` if they refer to the same
data.

### Example `*_coordsystem.json`

```json
{
    "IntendedFor": "bids::sub-01/ses-01/anat/sub-01_T1w.nii.gz",
    "iEEGCoordinateSystem": "ACPC",
    "iEEGCoordinateUnits": "mm",
    "iEEGCoordinateSystemDescription": "Coordinate system with the origin at anterior commissure (AC), negative y-axis going through the posterior commissure (PC), z-axis going to a mid-hemisperic point which lies superior to the AC-PC line, x-axis going to the right",
    "iEEGCoordinateProcessingDescription": "surface_projection",
    "iEEGCoordinateProcessingReference": "Hermes et al., 2010 JNeuroMeth"
}
```

## Photos of the electrode positions (`*_photo.<extension>`)

<!--

 https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/blob/master/macros_doc.md
-->
{{ MACROS___make_filename_template("raw", datatypes=["ieeg"], suffixes=["photo"]) }}

These can include photos of the electrodes on the brain surface, photos of
anatomical features or landmarks (such as sulcal structure), and fiducials. Photos
can also include an X-ray picture, a flatbed scan of a schematic drawing made
during surgery, or screenshots of a brain rendering with electrode positions.
The photos may need to be cropped and/or blurred to conceal identifying features
or entirely omitted prior to sharing, depending on obtained consent.

If there are photos of the electrodes, the [`acq-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#acq) entity should be specified
with:

-   `*_photo.<extension>` in case of an operative photo

-   `*_acq-xray#_photo.<extension>` in case of an x-ray picture

-   `*_acq-drawing#_photo.<extension>` in case of a drawing or sketch of electrode
    placements

-   `*_acq-render#_photo.<extension>` in case of a rendering

The [`ses-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#ses) entity may be used to specify when the photo was taken.

### Example `*_photo.<extension>`

Example of the operative photo of ECoG electrodes (here is an annotated example in
which electrodes and vasculature are marked, taken from Hermes et al.,
JNeuroMeth 2010).

## Electrical stimulation

In case of electrical stimulation of brain tissue by passing current through the
iEEG electrodes, and the electrical stimulation has an event structure (on-off,
onset, duration), the `*_events.tsv` file can contain the electrical stimulation
parameters in addition to other events. Note that these can be intermixed with
other task events. Electrical stimulation parameters can be described in columns
called `electrical_stimulation_<label>`, with labels chosen by the researcher and
optionally defined in more detail in an accompanying `*_events.json` file (as
per the main BIDS spec). Functions for complex stimulation patterns can, similar
as when a video is presented, be stored in a directory in the `/stimuli/` directory.
For example: `/stimuli/electrical_stimulation_functions/biphasic.tsv`
