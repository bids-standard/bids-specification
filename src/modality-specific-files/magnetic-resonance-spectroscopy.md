# Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy

Support for Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) was developed as a
[BIDS Extension Proposal](../extensions.md#bids-extension-proposals).
Please see [Citing BIDS](../introduction.md#citing-bids)
on how to appropriately credit this extension when referring to it in the
context of the academic literature.

!!! example "Example datasets"

    Several [example MRS datasets](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples?tab=readme-ov-file#mrs) have
    been formatted using this specification and can be used for practical guidance when curating a new dataset.

MRS is a spectroscopic technique based on the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance
that allows for the noninvasive detection and quantification of molecules in biochemical samples, such as brain tissue.
It can be conducted in humans using conventional MRI systems.

Due to the diversity in manufacturers' MRS data file formats, source data MUST be converted into the
[NIfTI-MRS format](https://wtclarke.github.io/mrs_nifti_standard/) (`*.nii[.gz]`) ([doi:10.1002/mrm.29418](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.29418)).
This format is based on the NIfTI framework and is designed to accommodate the nuances of raw MRS data.
All necessary information to parse this `*.nii[.gz]` file (for example, spectrometer frequency, echo time,
repetition time, and so on) are stored in a JSON header extension.
Conversion of proprietary MRS file formats to NIfTI-MRS and extraction of some (but not all) BIDS-compliant metadata can be performed
using [spec2nii](https://github.com/wtclarke/spec2nii).
Note that the "rawness" of data stored in the NIfTI-MRS file will depend on the format of the source data.
It is RECOMMENDED that users export their source data from the scanner in an appropriately raw format prior to conversion.

For MRSI data, "raw" signifies spatially reconstructed data (that is, data in image space rather than (*k*,*t*)-space),
given the complexity and diversity of sampling approaches.
Note that NIfTI-MRS is not designed to store data that has not been spatially reconstructed.

Regarding source data, each manufacturer has its own file format (sometimes multiple formats) for exporting MRS data from
the MRI scanner console for offline processing.
GE exports a P-file (`*.7`) that stores unprocessed, un-coil-combined data with metadata embedded
in a proprietary data header.
Philips has multiple export formats, the most common being the SDAT/SPAR format.
The `*.sdat` file contains either each coil-combined transient stored separately
or all transients summed into a signal average.
The `*.spar` file is a plaintext file describing acquisition parameters.
It is also possible to export raw data as `*.data`/`*.list` or DICOM files.
Siemens scanners allow data export in four formats:

1.  a proprietary DICOM-structured file known as IMA (`*.ima`);
1.  a conventional DICOM MR Spectroscopy Storage format (`*.dcm`);
1.  RDA (`*.rda`), a proprietary file format with a text-formatted header followed by the binary data points;
1.  TWIX (`*.dat`), a proprietary file format designed for storing unreconstructed, unprocessed MRS data from each individual coil element.

The IMA, DICOM MRS, and RDA formats are typically used to export reconstructed and processed data;
however, the sequence designer may choose to also allow the export of un-averaged transients
or data from individual coil elements.
Bruker data are are exported as two binary files: one file stores each transient separately,
while the other stores the sum of the transients.
A separate plaintext file stores the sequence name, voxel position, voxel orientation, and other metadata.
All of these files are considered source data and, if present, MUST be stored in the
[`sourcedata`](../common-principles.md#source-vs-raw-vs-derived-data) directory.

### Single-voxel spectroscopy and MRS imaging

| **Name**                                 | **`suffix`** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single-voxel spectroscopy                | svs          | MRS acquisitions where the detected MR signal is spatially localized to a single volume.                                                                                               |
| Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging | mrsi         | MRS acquisitions where additional imaging gradients are used to detect the MR signal from 1, 2, or 3 spatial dimensions.                                                               |
| Unlocalized spectroscopy                 | unloc        | MRS acquisitions run without localization. This includes signals detected using coil sensitivity only.                                                                                 |
| Concentration or calibration reference   | mrsref       | An MRS acquisition collected to serve as a concentration reference for absolute quantification or as a calibration reference for preprocessing (for example, eddy-current correction). |

A major distinction between MRS acquisitions is whether the acquisition technique probes spectral
information from a single volume (single-voxel spectroscopy, SVS) or encodes this information along
1, 2, or 3 spatial dimensions resulting in multiple sub-volumes (MRS imaging, MRSI).
To avoid confusion, the suffixes `svs` and `mrsi` MUST be used to distinguish the two techniques.
For cases where localization is not used, the suffix `unloc` MUST be used.

Furthermore, it is common to acquire an additional MRS dataset that may serve as a reference for
scaling metabolite signal levels (for example, to obtain concentrations) and/or for preprocessing steps (such as
eddy-current correction, RF coil combination, phasing, and frequency calibration).
This could be either an external reference (for example, a phantom or a synthetic signal) or, more typically,
an internal tissue water reference.
For such datasets, the suffix `mrsref` MUST be used.
Should multiple references exist for a given dataset, the user MAY use the `acq-<label>` entity to distinguish the files.
For example, `sub-01_acq-conc_mrsref.nii.gz` and `sub-01_acq-ecc_mrsref.nii.gz` could be used to name
two references to be used for concentration scaling and eddy-current correction, respectively.

### MRS sequences

Given the large variety of MRS sequences, there will be times when providing sufficient detail of
acquisition parameters in filenames is helpful or necessary to distinguish datasets in a given study.

Here we present a set of labels that can be used when using the `acq-<label>` entity in the filename.
These are based on the most commonly used in vivo MRS sequences/techniques, and are OPTIONAL to use.
Users are free to choose any label they wish as long as they are consistent across participants
and sessions and use only legal label characters.
If used, the chosen label SHOULD also be described in the `PulseSequenceType` field in the sidecar JSON file.

| LASER                                       | laser       | LASER uses three pairs of slice-selective 180° adiabatic full-passage (AFP) refocusing pulses for localization. These are preceded by a non-slice-selective adiabatic half-passage (AHP) excitation pulse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| sLASER                                      | slaser      | sLASER is a modification of LASER where the AHP and first pair of AFP pulses are replaced with a non-adiabatic slice-selective 90° excitation pulse, typically employed to reduce the minimum TE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| SPECIAL                                     | special     | SPECIAL is a two-shot experiment. In the first shot, a pre-excitation slice-selective 180° AFP inversion pulse precedes a spin-echo acquisition with slice selection (90°–180°–acq). In the second shot, the adiabatic pulse is not applied. The 3D localized signal is derived by subtracting the two shots.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| MEGA                                        | mega        | MEGA is a spectral editing technique that applies narrowband frequency-selective 180° pulses to refocus *J*-coupled spins at a specific frequency without affecting the spins of metabolites with resonances beyond the frequency range. Applying these pulses in alternating scans (for example, edit ON and edit OFF) and then subtracting the ON/OFF pairs results in a *J*-difference-edited spectrum that removes the unedited signals, leaving only those signals that were affected by the editing pulses. |
| HERMES                                      | hermes      | HERMES is an extension of MEGA editing whereby the two-step experiment becomes a four-step experiment. This permits multiple metabolites to be edited in a multiplexed manner. By employing Hadamard combination of the four edited sub-spectra, HERMES can reveal several metabolites unambiguously.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Multiple quantum coherence (MQC) editing    | mqc         | MQC editing targets *J*-coupled resonances by selecting desired coherence pathways using MQ gradients and frequency-selective RF pulses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Localized correlation spectroscopy (L-COSY) | lcosy       | L-COSY is a 2D MRS technique whereby one of the interpulse durations is changed sequentially. A 2D Fourier transform produces a 2D spectrum that displays singlets on the diagonal and *J*-coupled metabolites on the off-diagonal, with the offsets equal to the *J*-coupling constants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| *J*-resolved spectroscopy                   | j           | Another 2D technique, where in a *J*-resolved acquisition, a series of transients are collected at different TEs. A 2D Fourier transform is applied to generate a 2D spectrum where one dimension characterizes both chemical shift and *J*-coupling and the other only *J*-coupling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Diffusion-weighted (DW) spectroscopy        | dw          | The diffusion of intracellular metabolites can be characterized using DW spectroscopy. In such acquisitions, the strength of gradients in a conventional MRS sequence is modulated to sensitize the metabolite signals to diffusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| FID spectroscopy                            | fid         | FID spectroscopy is a pulse-acquire acquisition where an excitation pulse is followed by direct acquisition of the FID. This approach is most often used in MRSI (that is, FID-MRSI) when combined with slice- or slab-selection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Each `<label>` in the table above MAY be combined with another to better describe the acquisition used.
For example, `megaspecial`, `jpress`, `dwslaser`, `mcdwsteam`, and so on.

The OPTIONAL `nuc-<label>` entity can be used to distinguish acquisitions tuned to detect different nuclei.
The label is the name of the nucleus or nuclei, which corresponds to DICOM Tag 0018, 9100.
For example, `nuc-1H`, `nuc-31P`, `nuc-1H13C`.
If used, the field `ResonantNucleus` MUST also be included in the corresponding sidecar JSON file, using the same label.

Similarly, the OPTIONAL `voi-<label>` entity can be used to distinguish between
acquisitions localized to different regions (that is, acquisitions with different VOI).
The label SHOULD be the name of the body region or part scanned.
If used, the fields `BodyPart` and `BodyPartDetails` MUST also be included in the corresponding sidecar JSON file.
`BodyPartDetailsOntology` is OPTIONAL to also include.

## Sidecar JSON

MRS data files MUST be described by metadata fields, stored in sidecar JSON files (`*.json`).

### Common metadata fields

Metadata described in the following sections are shared with other MR modalities that SHOULD
or MAY be present in the sidecar JSON files.
