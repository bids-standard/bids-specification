In addition to logs from behavioral experiments performed alongside imaging data
acquisitions, one can also include data from experiments performed with no neural
recordings.
The results of those experiments can be stored in the `beh` directory using the same
formats for event timing (`_events.tsv`), metadata (`_events.json`),
physiological (`_physio.tsv.gz`, `_physio.json`)
and other continuous recordings (`_stim.tsv.gz`, `_stim.json`)
as for tasks performed during MRI, electrophysiological or other neural recordings.
Additionally, events files that do not include the mandatory `onset` and
`duration` columns can still be included, but should be labeled `_beh.tsv`
rather than `_events.tsv`.

## RECOMMENDED metadata

In addition to the metadata that is either:

-   RECOMMENDED for sidecar JSON files for [tabular data](../common-principles.md#tabular-data), or

-   REQUIRED for some data that can be found in the `beh` directory
    (for example `SamplingFrequency` and `StartTime` for `*_<physio|stim>.tsv.gz` files),

it is RECOMMENDED to add the following metadata to the JSON files of this directory:

<!-- This block generates a metadata table.
These tables are defined in
  src/schema/rules/sidecars
The definitions of the fields specified in these tables may be found in
  src/schema/objects/metadata.yaml

Example of the content of a `_beh.tsv` and its accompanying `_beh.json` sidecar file:

```Text
trial	response	response_time	stim_file
congruent	red	1.435	images/word-red_color-red.jpg
incongruent	red	1.739	images/word-red_color-blue.jpg
```

In the accompanying JSON sidecar, the `trial` column might be documented as follows:

```JSON
{
   "TaskName": "Stroop",
   "trial": {
      "LongName": "Trial name",
      "Description": "Indicator of the type of trial",
      "Levels": {
         "congruent": "Word and font color match.",
         "incongruent": "Word and font color do not match."
      }
   }
}
```
