# Magnetoencephalography

Support for Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was developed as a
[BIDS Extension Proposal](../extensions.md#bids-extension-proposals).
Please see [Citing BIDS](../introduction.md#citing-bids)
on how to appropriately credit this extension when referring to it in the
context of the academic literature.

!!! example "Example datasets"

    The following example MEG datasets have been formatted using this specification
    and can be used for practical guidance when curating a new dataset.

    -   [`multimodal MEG and MRI`](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples/tree/master/ds000117)

    Further datasets are available from
    the [BIDS examples repository](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-examples/#meg).

## MEG recording data

   datatypes=["meg"],
   suffixes=["meg", "markers", "events", "physio", "stim"])
}}

Unprocessed MEG data MUST be stored in the native file format of the MEG
instrument with which the data was collected.
With the MEG specification of BIDS, we wish to promote the adoption of good
practices in the management of scientific data.
Hence, the emphasis is not to impose a new, generic data format for the
modality, but rather to standardize the way data is stored in repositories.
Further, there is currently no widely accepted standard file format for MEG, but
major software applications, including free and open-source solutions for MEG
data analysis, provide readers of such raw files.

Some software readers may skip important metadata that is specific to MEG system
manufacturers. It is therefore RECOMMENDED that users provide additional meta
information extracted from the manufacturer raw data files in a sidecar JSON
file. This allows for easy searching and indexing of key metadata elements
without the need to parse files in proprietary data format. Other relevant files
MAY be included alongside the MEG data; examples are provided below.

This template is for MEG data of any kind, including but not limited to
task-based, resting-state, and noise recordings.
If multiple *Tasks* were performed within a single *Run*,
the task description can be set to `task-multitask`.
The `*_meg.json` file SHOULD contain details on the *Tasks*.

Some manufacturers' data storage conventions use directories which contain data
files of various nature: for example, CTF's `.ds` format, or BTi/4D's data directory.
Yet other manufacturers split their files once they exceed a certain size
limit.
For example Neuromag/Elekta/Megin, which can produce several files
for a single recording.
Both `some_file.fif` and `some_file-1.fif` would belong to a single recording.
In BIDS, the [`split`](../appendices/entities.md#split) entity is RECOMMENDED to deal
with split files.
If there are multiple parts of a recording and the optional `scans.tsv` is provided,
remember to list all files separately in `scans.tsv` and that the entries for the
`acq_time` column in `scans.tsv` MUST all be identical, as described in
[Scans file](../modality-agnostic-files.md#scans-file).

The Neuromag/Elekta/Megin system may also produce datasets that require a set of
`crosstalk` and `calibration` files to be used properly (see also filename templates above).
Please refer to
[Cross-talk and fine-calibration files](../appendices/meg-file-formats.md#cross-talk-and-fine-calibration-files)
for more information on this detail.

Another manufacturer-specific detail pertains to the KIT/Yokogawa/Ricoh system,
which saves the MEG sensor coil positions in a separate file with two possible filename extensions  (`.sqd`, `.mrk`).
For these files, the `markers` suffix MUST be used.
For example: `sub-01_task-nback_markers.sqd`

Please refer to the [MEG File Formats Appendix](../appendices/meg-file-formats.md)
for general information on how to deal with such manufacturer specifics and to see more examples.

The [`proc-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#proc) entity is analogous to the
[`rec-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#rec) entity for MRI,
and denotes a variant of a file that was a result of particular processing performed on the device.
This is useful for files produced in particular by Neuromag/Elekta/MEGIN's MaxFilter
(for example, sss, tsss, trans, quat, mc),
which some installations impose to be run on raw data prior to analysis.
Such processing steps are needed for example because of active shielding software corrections
that have to be performed to before the MEG data can actually be exploited.

### Recording (i)EEG simultaneously with MEG

Note that if (i)EEG is recorded with a separate amplifier,
it SHOULD be stored separately under a new `/eeg` data type
(see the [EEG](electroencephalography.md) and
[iEEG](intracranial-electroencephalography.md) specifications).

If however (i)EEG is recorded simultaneously **with the same MEG system**,
it MAY be stored under the `/meg` data type.
In that case, it SHOULD have the same sampling frequency as MEG (see `SamplingFrequency` field below).
Furthermore, (i)EEG sensor coordinates MAY be recorded in an
[`electrodes.tsv`](electroencephalography.md#electrodes-description-_electrodestsv)
file using MEG-specific coordinate systems
(see [Coordinate System JSON](#coordinate-system-json-_coordsystemjson) below and
the [Coordinate Systems Appendix](../appendices/coordinate-systems.md)).

{{ MACROS___make_sidecar_table("meg.MEGCoordsystemAnatomicalLandmarks") }}

It is also RECOMMENDED that the MRI voxel coordinates of the actual anatomical
landmarks for co-registration of MEG with structural MRI are stored in the
`AnatomicalLandmarkCoordinates` field in the JSON sidecar of the corresponding
T1w MRI anatomical data of the subject seen in the MEG session
(see [Anatomy Imaging Data](magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.md#anatomy-imaging-data)).

For example: `"sub-01/ses-mri/anat/sub-01_ses-mri_acq-mprage_T1w.json"`

In principle, these locations are those of absolute anatomical markers. However,
the marking of NAS, LPA and RPA is more ambiguous than that of for example, AC and PC.
This may result in some variability in their 3-D digitization from session to
session, even for the same participant. The solution would be to use only one
T1w file and populate the `AnatomicalLandmarkCoordinates` field with
session-specific labels for example, "NAS-session1": `[127,213,139]`,"NAS-session2":
`[123,220,142]`.

Photos of the anatomical landmarks and/or head localization coils
(`*_photo.<extension>`)

-->
{{ MACROS___make_filename_template("raw", datatypes=["meg"], suffixes=["photo"]) }}

Photos of the anatomical landmarks and/or head localization coils on the
subject's head are RECOMMENDED. If the coils are not placed at the location of
actual anatomical landmarks, these latter may be marked with a piece of felt-tip
taped to the skin. Please note that the photos may need to be cropped or blurred
to conceal identifying features prior to sharing, depending on the terms of the
consent given by the participant.

The [`acq-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#acq) entity can be used to indicate acquisition of different photos of
the same face (or other body part in different angles to show, for example, the
location of the nasion (NAS) as opposed to the right periauricular point (RPA)).

### Example `*_photo.<extension>`

Example of the NAS fiducial placed between the eyebrows, rather than at the
actual anatomical nasion: `sub-0001_ses-001_acq-NAS_photo.jpg`

-->
{{ MACROS___make_filename_template("raw", datatypes=["meg"], suffixes=["headshape"]) }}

This file is RECOMMENDED.

The 3-D locations of points that describe the head shape and/or EEG
electrode locations can be digitized and stored in separate files. The
[`acq-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#acq) entity can be used when more than one type of digitization in done for
a session, for example when the head points are in a separate file from the EEG
locations. These files are stored in the specific format of the 3-D digitizer's
manufacturer (see the [MEG File Formats Appendix](../appendices/meg-file-formats.md)).

For example:

<!-- This block generates a file tree.
A guide for using macros can be found at
 https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/blob/master/macros_doc.md
-->
{{ MACROS___make_filetree_example(
   {
   "sub-control01": {
      "ses-01":{
         "sub-control01_ses-01_acq-HEAD_headshape.pos": "",
         "sub-control01_ses-01_acq-EEG_headshape.pos": "",
         },
      }
   }
) }}

Note that the `*_headshape` file(s) is shared by all the runs and tasks in a
session. If the subject needs to be taken out of the scanner and the head-shape
has to be updated, then for MEG it could be considered to be a new session.

## Empty-room MEG recordings

Empty-room MEG recordings capture the environmental and recording system's noise.

It is RECOMMENDED to explicitly specify which empty-room recording should be used with which experimental run(s) or session(s).
This can be done via the [`AssociatedEmptyRoom`](../glossary.md#associatedemptyroom-metadata) field in the `*_meg.json` sidecar files.

Empty-room recordings may be collected once per day, where a single empty-room recording may be shared between multiple subjects and/or sessions (see [Example 1](#example-1)).
Empty-room recordings may also be collected for each individual experimental session (see [Example 2](#example-2)).
In either case, the label for the [`task-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#task) entity in the empty-room recording SHOULD be set to `noise`.

### Example 1

One empty-room recording per day, applying to all subjects for that day.

In the case of empty-room recordings being associated with multiple subjects and/or sessions,
it is RECOMMENDED to store the empty-room recording inside a subject directory named `sub-emptyroom`.
If a [`session-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#ses) entity is present, its label SHOULD be the date of the empty-room recording in the format `YYYYMMDD`, that is `ses-YYYYMMDD`.
The `scans.tsv` file containing the date and time of the acquisition SHOULD also be included.
The rationale is that this naming scheme will allow users to easily retrieve the empty-room recording that best matches a particular experimental session, based on date and time of the recording.
It should be possible to query empty-room recordings just like usual subject recordings, hence all metadata sidecar files (such as the `channels.tsv`) file SHOULD be present as well.

            }
         }
      },
   }
) }}

### Example 2

One empty-room recording per each participant's session, stored within the session directory.

In the case of empty-room recordings being collected for the individual experimental session,
it is RECOMMENDED to store the empty-room recording along with that subject and session.
