# Microelectrode Electrophysiology

Support for Microelectrode Electrophysiology was developed as a [BIDS Extension Proposal](../extensions.md#bids-extension-proposals) [BEP032: Animal electrophysiology (ephys)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/bep032).
Please see [Citing BIDS](../introduction.md#citing-bids) on how to appropriately credit this extension
when referring to it in the context of the academic literature.

This BEP has been initiated by members of the INCF Working Group on Standardized Data Structures,
that was initiated in 2020 to develop a set of specifications and tools
that would allow the standardization of a directory structure for experimental data recorded
with animal models in neuroscience, and its associated metadata.

Most core principles of the original BIDS and particulars of BIDS-iEEG specification are adopted
for this modality as well, though some special considerations and additional fields were added.

!!! example "Example datasets"

    Several [example Microelectrode Electrophysiology datasets](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-examples/#microephys)
    have been formatted using this specification and can be used for practical guidance when curating a new dataset.

## Primary data file formats

Microelectrode electrophysiology (`microephys`) modality data (of `icephys` or `ecephys` datatypes) must be stored in an [open file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_format),
while the native format, if different, can be stored in an optional  `sourcedata/` directory.
The native file format is used in case conversion elicits the loss of crucial metadata specific to manufacturers and specific acquisition systems.
Metadata should be included alongside the data in the `.json` and `.tsv` files.
The current list of allowed data file formats:

| **Format**                                                                          | **Extension(s)** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Neuroscience Information Exchange Format](https://nixio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | `.nix`           | A generic and open  framework with an hdf5 backend and a defined interface to many ephys formats via the [Neo library](https://neo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The `.nix` file has to contain a valid Neo structure. |
| [Neurodata Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org)                                    | `.nwb`           | An open data standard for neurophysiology, including data from intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology experiments.                                                                                        |

Both of these formats can also store essential metadata of the datasets.
Some of this metadata needs to be duplicated in BIDS `.tsv` and `.json` sidecar files.
Even though the duplication requires additional effort to ensure the consistency of the data, it provides several advantages:
- It makes the dataset easier for humans to scan, as essential information is easily accessible without loading the data files.
- The dataset adheres to the BIDS standard and can benefit from tools built on top of this standard, such as [bids-validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator).
- It simplifies the separation of data and basic metadata, enabling, for example, the publication of a dataset in a lightweight fashion with access to the data files on request (as implemented by [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org)).

#  PARTICIPANT keyfiles
## Participant information

The `participants.tsv` file is located at the root of the data set directory.
Its presence is RECOMMENDED in order to describe information about the individual subjects (animals) from which the data was recorded.
It follows the [general BIDS specifications to describe participants](../modality-agnostic-files.md#participants-file).

On top of the existing columns that can be present in this file and that are described in the BIDS specifications (`participant_id`, `species`, `strain`, `strain_rrid`, `sex`, `handedness`, and `age`), we propose to allow adding the following ones:


#  EPHYS specific files

The following metadata files are REQUIRED for a given animal ephys session:

1. `[_ses-<session_label>]_probes.tsv`: A REQUIRED file listing information on the device used to acquire the electrophysiology data, such as implant or probe specification, location, material, and others.
2. `[_ses-<session_label>]_electrodes.tsv`: A REQUIRED file listing information on the points of electrical contact to the tissue, such as impedance, names, relative positions, and others.
3. `[_ses-<session_label>]_channels.tsv`: A REQUIRED file listing information on the recorded signals, such as preprocessing, filtering, ids, and others.

As with all tsv-based metadata files in BIDS the probes, electrodes and channels tsv files can be accompanied by json sidecar files.


## Coordinate System JSON (`*_coordsystem.json`) & Photos of electrode positions (`_photo.jpg`)

This file provides metadata on the global coordinate system in which the electrodes are placed.
This file is **RECOMMENDED**, and the listed required fields below must be included if a `*_coordsystem.json` file is provided.

The coordinate system can be defined using reference pictures, anatomical landmarks, brain images, or a reference atlas.
For more details, see the [BIDS Coordinate Systems specifications](../appendices/coordinate-systems.md).


Fields relating to the ephys probe and electrode  positions:

{{ MACROS___make_metadata_table(
   {
        "MicroephysCoordinateSystem":"REQUIRED",
        "MicroephysCoordinateUnits":"REQUIRED",
        "MicroephysCoordinateSystemDescription":"RECOMMENDED",
        "MicroephysCoordinateSystemPhoto":"OPTIONAL",
        "MEGCoordinateSystem":"REQUIRED",
   }
) }}

### Allowed 2D coordinate systems

If electrodes are localized in 2D space (only `x` and `y` are specified, and `z` is `"n/a"`),
then the positions in this file MUST correspond to the locations expressed in pixels on the
photo, drawing, or rendering of the electrodes on the brain.

In this case, `ephysCoordinateSystem` MUST be defined as `"Pixels"`,
and `ephysCoordinateUnits` MUST be defined as `"pixels"` (note the difference in capitalization).

Furthermore, the coordinates MUST be `(row,column)` pairs,
with `(0,0)` corresponding to the upper-left pixel and `(N,0)` corresponding to the lower-left pixel.


### Photos of the electrode positions (`*_photo.jpg`)

These can include photos of the electrodes on the brain surface,
photos of anatomical features or landmarks (such as sulcal structures), and fiducials.
Photos can also include an X-ray picture, a flatbed scan of a schematic drawing made during surgery,
or screenshots of a brain rendering with electrode positions.

The photos may need to be cropped and/or blurred to conceal identifying features
or entirely omitted prior to sharing, depending on the obtained consent.

If there are photos of the electrodes, the [`_acq-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#acq) entity should be specified with:

- `*_photo.jpg` for an operative photo.
- `*_acq-xray#_photo.<extension>` for an X-ray picture.
- `*_acq-drawing#_photo.<extension>` for a drawing or sketch of electrode placements.
- `*_acq-render#_photo.<extension>` for a rendering.

The file `<extension>` for photos MUST be either `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.tif`.

The [`ses-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#ses) entity may be used to specify when the photo was taken.


## **Multiple coordinate systems**

The optional[` space-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#space) entity (`*[_space-<label>]_coordsystem.json`) can be used to indicate how to interpret the electrode positions. The space `<label>` MUST be taken from one of the modality specific lists in the [Coordinate Systems Appendix](../appendices/coordinate-systems.md). For example for iEEG data, the restricted keywords listed under[ iEEG Specific Coordinate Systems](../coordinate-systems.md#ieeg-specific-coordinate-systems) are acceptable for `<label>`.


## Probes (*_probes.tsv)

Probes are physical devices used for recording animal electrophysiology (ephys) data.
They can be permanently implanted (chronic recordings) or inserted temporarily for the recording (acute recordings).

The probe positions and properties are stored in a `.tsv` file.
This file contains the probe ID, the type of recording (acute/chronic), and the probe coordinates.
The surgical coordinates of the probe can be described using AP, DV, LR, yaw, pitch, and roll.

These measurements follow the convention of the Pinpoint software for surgical planning and are intended to describe the surgical plan:

### Translational Coordinates

- `(0,0,0)` is assumed to be Bregma when working with rodents.
- It may optionally be defined differently and **must** be defined for other species.
- `x, y, z` represents posterior, ventral, and right directions, respectively, in micrometers (`µm`).

### Rotational Coordinates

- `(0,0,0)` corresponds to the probe facing up with the tip pointing forward.
- Rotations are measured in degrees, clockwise, and around the tip.
- For multi-shank probes, the “tip” of the probe is defined as the end of the left shank when facing the electrodes.

#### Rotation Definitions:

- **Yaw**: Clockwise rotation when looking down.
- **Pitch**: Rotation in the direction of the electrode face.
- **Roll**: Clockwise rotation when looking down at the probe.

### ProbeInterface Library
`ProbeInterface` is a library that defines a standard for specifying electrode layouts on probes.
The `ProbeInterface` library includes layouts for many common probes.

The `ProbeInterface` model corresponding to your probe can be referenced using:

- `probeinterface_manufacturer`
- `probeinterface_model`

If provided, these should point to a `ProbeInterface` model in the `ProbeInterface` library,
at the location:


{{ MACROS___make_columns_table("microephys.microephysProbes") }}


Example of `_probes.tsv`:

```Text
probe_id	hemisphere	x	y	z	type		material	location
p023		left		-11.87	-1.30	-3.37	utah-array	iridium-oxide	V1
p023		left		-11.64	0.51	-4.20	utah-array	iridium-oxide	V2
p021		left		-12.11	-3.12	-2.54	utah-array	iridium-oxide	V4
p021		left		-9.94	-1.19	-2.86	utah-array	iridium-oxide	V3
```


## Electrodes  (*_electrodes.tsv)

Electrodes describe the points of contact between the electrodes and the tissue used for recording electrophysiological signals.

The electrode positions and properties are stored in a `.tsv` file (amplifier information is in `channels.tsv`).

This file contains the following information:
- The electrode name
- The electrode coordinates in 3 columns (`xyz`)
- The ID of the probe the electrode is located on

The coordinates are relative to the position on the probe.



{{ MACROS___make_columns_table("microephys.microephysElectrodes") }}


Example of * _electrodes.tsv:

```Text
probe_id	impedance	x	y	z	material	location
e0123	p023	1.1	-11.87	-1.30	-3.37	iridium-oxide	V1
e234	p023	1.5	-11.64	0.51	-4.20	iridium-oxide	V2
e934	p021	3.5	-12.11	-3.12	-2.54	iridium-oxide	V4
e234	p021	7.0	-9.94	-1.19	-2.86	iridium-oxide	V3
```

### Channels  (*_channels.tsv)

Channels are virtual sources of recorded signals.
These may be of neuronal origin (for example, online filtered LFP signals) or generated by the recording setup
(for example, synchronization or behavioral signals).

The channel properties are stored in a `.tsv` file.
This file contains the following information:

- `channel_id`
- `electrode_id` (in the case of neuronal signals)
- Amplifier information
- …

For more information about the distinction between electrodes and channels, see [the corresponding section in iEEG](./intracranial-electroencephalography.md#terminology-electrodes-vs-channels).

Columns in the `*_channel.tsv` file are:


{{ MACROS___make_columns_table("microephys.microephysChannels") }}


Example of * _channels.tsv:


```Text
channel_id	electrode_id	gain	type	units	sampling_frequency	status
c0123	con0123	30	EXT	mV	30000	good
c234	con234	30	EXT	mV	30000	good
c934	con934	50	EXT	mV	30000	bad
c234	n/a	1	SYNC	mV	1000	good
```

Note: In many datasets multiple sets of identifiers are used for probes, electrodes and channels.
We RECOMMEND to include alternative sets of identifiers, e.g. identifiers that enumerate electrodes according to their spatial arrangement, as additional custom columns in the .tsv file.

**Recommended Channel Type Values**

For the `type` column we recommend to use the following terms (adopted from [iEEG](intracranial-electroencephalography.md#channelselectrode-description-_channelselectrodestsv))

## General ephys metadata (*_ephys.json)

We propose to store all metadata that is not directly related to one of the other metadata files (probe/electrode/channel information) into a single JSON file: `_ephys.json`.

There should be one such JSON file for each data file.

The `*_ephys.json` file can be used to store any ephys-specific metadata for the dataset. We recommend storing all setup-related metadata in a dedicated node of the JSON file called `Setup`.
We recommend using the following keys to describe the setup:

### Data origin metadata


{{ MACROS___make_metadata_table(
   {
        "InstitutionName":"RECOMMENDED",
        "InstitutionAddress":"RECOMMENDED",
        "InstitutionalDepartmentName":"RECOMMENDED",
   }
) }}


### Setup metadata


{{ MACROS___make_metadata_table(
   {
        "PowerLineFrequency":"REQUIRED",
        "Manufacturer":"RECOMMENDED",
        "ManufacturersModelName":"RECOMMENDED",
        "ManufacturersModelVersion":"RECOMMENDED",
        "RecordingSetupName":"RECOMMENDED",
        "SamplingFrequency":"REQUIRED",
        "DeviceSerialNumber":"RECOMMENDED",
        "SoftwareName":"RECOMMENDED",
        "SoftwareVersions":"RECOMMENDED",
   }
) }}


### Processing metadata


{{ MACROS___make_metadata_table(
   {
        "SoftwareFilters":"REQUIRED",
        "HardwareFilters":"RECOMMENDED",
   }
) }}


### Additional recording procedure

Furthermore, additional information can be stored about the recording procedure.
We RECOMMEND to use a dedicated `Procedure` node with the following keys:

<!--Ask reema how she have implemented it-->

{{ MACROS___make_metadata_table(
   {
        "Pharmaceuticals":"OPTIONAL",
        "SupplementarySignals":"OPTIONAL",
        "BodyPart":"RECOMMENDED",
        "BodyPartDetails":"RECOMMENDED",
        "BodyPartOntology":"OPTIONAL",
        "SampleEnvironment":"RECOMMENDED",
        "SampleEmbedding":"OPTIONAL",
        "SliceThickness":"OPTIONAL",
        "SampleExtractionProtocol":"OPTIONAL",
   }
) }}


### Probes

It is RECOMMENDED to use the following structure to provide more metadata for each probe:

```JSON
"ProbeContours":{
   "probe_infoid": {
      "<my_probe_id>": {
         "Contour": <list of contour points>,
         "Unit": "<my spatial unit>"
      }
   }
}
```


Whereas `<my_probe_id>` has to exist also in the `probes.tsv` file and `<list of contour points>` is
a list of x, y(, z) tuples providing the contour of the probe in the same reference frame as the
electrode coordinates (see `electrodes.tsv`).
In case of different units used than in the `electrodes.tsv`, the key `Unit` can be used here to
provide the spatial unit of the coordinate points.


### Task (*see also  iEEG.json*)

If the OPTIONAL [` task-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#task) is used, the following metadata SHOULD be used.

{{ MACROS___make_metadata_table(
   {
        "TaskName":"RECOMMENDED",
        "TaskDescription":"RECOMMENDED",
        "Instructions":"RECOMMENDED",
        "CogAtlasID":"RECOMMENDED",
        "CogPOID":"RECOMMENDED",
   }
) }}


### Example of * _ephys.json:

      }
   },
"TaskName": "Reach-to-Grasp",
"TaskDescription": "A task that involves the reaching of an object and holding it for a specific time"
}
}
```

## Recording Events (*_events.tsv)

The `*_events.tsv` and corresponding `*_events.json` sidecar files are OPTIONAL and can be used to
indicate time points of recording events. Each task events file requires a corresponding task data
file. These events can be internal recording system events, task-related events, or events triggered
by the experimentalist (for example, manual reward). Note that these events must share a common clock
with the corresponding ephys recording data. For more details, see the
Task Events documentation.
Note that this file can also be used to describe stimulation performed during the recording. For this,
please follow the iEEG stimulation documentation.




## Multi-part recordings

Two different procedures are supported to handle multi-part recordings. In short, the two options are:
i) each recording is stored in an independent data file, and the corresponding metadata is described
in the `*_scans.tsv` file; or
ii) several recordings are stored in a single data file, and the corresponding metadata is described
in the `*_events.tsv` file.
These two options are made available to support different usages and habits of the experimenters, as
well as to benefit from the capability of the supported data formats (NWB and NIX).
They are described in the following subsections, and made explicit through some of the example data sets.


### Multiple tasks / runs in separate files (*_scans.tsv)

The `*_scans.tsv` should be used to provide information about multiple parts of an acquisition
session (for example, recording start times in case the recording was paused and restarted)
when the data from each of these different recordings is stored in separate files.
Each data file should have a name that contains a `_task-XX` and/or `_run-XX` suffix, and
should be described by at most one row in the `*_scans.tsv` file. See also the BIDS Scans
specification.
Relative paths to files should be used under a compulsory “filename” header.
If acquisition time is included, it should be with the “acq_time” header. Datetime should
be expressed in the following format 2009-06-15T13:45:30 (year, month, day, hour (24h),
minute, second; this is equivalent to the RFC3339 “date-time” format, time zone is always
assumed as local time).
The run and task keywords and the corresponding `*_scans.tsv` file are OPTIONAL and can be
ignored if the dataset consists of only one continuous recording and a single or no task.


Optional: Yes


Example of * _scans.tsv:


```Text
filename	acq_time
ephys/sub-P001_task-pull_run-01_ephys.nix	2018-07-15T09:45:30
ephys/sub-P001_task-pull_run-02_ephys.nix	2018-07-15T13:24:00
ephys/sub-P001_task-push_run-01_ephys.nix	2018-07-15T14:24:00
ephys/sub-P001_task-push_run-02_ephys.nix	2018-07-15T15:24:00

It is recommended to accompany the  `*_scans.tsv` file with a corresponding `*_scans.json`
sidecar file, as described in the [BIDS specifications](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/03-modality-agnostic-files.html#scans-file).


### Multiple recordings in a single data file (*_events.tsv)

The `*_events.tsv` should be used to provide information about multiple parts of an acquisition
session when the data from each of these different recordings is stored in a single data file.
In such a case, this file is REQUIRED.
This allows benefiting from the capability of the supported data formats (NIX and NWB) to store multiple
recordings in a single file, which can be convenient when these recordings share numerous characteristics
(for example, for subsequent recordings obtained on a single cell in intracellular electrophysiology).
In such case, the information about these recordings should be stored in columns added in the
`*_events.tsv` file, which are listed now.

Optional column names in `events.tsv` to support multiple recordings in a single data file:

#### Extracellular Electrophysiology

This dataset contains data from a single subject (subject A), that was recorded on two
days (2022-01-01 and 2022-01-02).
On the first day it performed two tasks (nose-poke & rest), and on the second day only a
rest task was performed.
Detailed information about these tasks can be found in the `tasks.tsv` and `tasks.json` files.
The electrophysiology data for each of the three recordings are stored in the corresponding
session and ephys directories in the `nix` format. Metadata about the probes, their electrodes
and the corresponding recording channels are stored in `tsv` format. Note that in this case,
this information is shared between data files (see BIDS Inheritance Principle): in the first session,
the probe, electrode and channel files apply to both data files of that session, as they do not
contain a `task` entity in their name. For the nose-poke task, additional behavioral timestamps
(events) were recorded and stored in an additional `events.tsv` file.

#### Intracellular Electrophysiology (Patch)

This dataset contains intracellular data from slices acquired from two subjects (20220101-A and 20220101B). Details about the subjects and the sample generation are documented in the samples (tsv/json) files. Data of each subject is stored in separate subject directories (top level directories), each of which contains an ‘ephys’ subdirectory. Note that there is no session-level directory in this case. Here, we choose the option of having “multiple tasks/runs in separate files” as described in 3.81., to demonstrate the high level of readability offered by the filenames in this case.

For the first subject only a single sample (a cell for patch-clamp terminology) was extracted (sample-cell001), on which two recordings (runs 1 and 2) were performed. Here, the `scans.tsv` file can be used to store information such as the starting recording times. The detailed information on the recording channel (e.g. also the recording mode used) is stored in the `channels.tsv` which, in this case, is common to all available recordings. The probes and electrodes files provide information on the pipette and solutions used for the recordings and are also shared for the two data files.

For the second subject two samples (sample-cell003 and sample-cell004) were extracted and a single recording performed on each of them. Each recording was performed using a different probe (listed in the probes.tsv) having specific electrode and channel information. Therefore, each data file has a dedicated channel and electrode file with the same name as the data file.

This toy data set can be found in [this repository,](https://gin.g-node.org/NeuralEnsemble/BEP032-examples/src/master/toy-dataset_patchclamp_single-record-per-file) with the content of the metadata files. The other option available to organize such data consists in storing several recordings in a single data file (as described in 3.8.2); the same data set is presented using this latter option in [this other repository](https://gin.g-node.org/NeuralEnsemble/BEP032-examples/src/master/toy-dataset_patchclamp_multiple-records-per-file), so that both options can be compared for the same data set.


## Examples of real datasets

Multiple datasets have been converted to follow this BEP proposal. These datasets typically have pruned data files to reduce the data file size, but are accompanied by the full set of metadata. A current version of these datasets can be found on GIN: [https://gin.g-node.org/NeuralEnsemble/BEP032-examples](https://gin.g-node.org/NeuralEnsemble/BEP032-examples)

For a complete dataset including all data samples the ephys dataset published in [Brochier (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.55) has been reorganized according to the current version of this BEP, using the NIX data format. The up-to-date version of the dataset can be found here:

[https://gin.g-node.org/sprenger/multielectrode_grasp/src/bep_animalephys](https://gin.g-node.org/sprenger/multielectrode_grasp/src/bep_animalephys)

We will also publish another dataset using the NWB data format in the near future, and a dataset acquired
