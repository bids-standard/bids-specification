# Physiological recordings

Physiological recordings such as cardiac and respiratory signals MAY be
specified using a [compressed tabular file](../common-principles.md#compressed-tabular-files)
([TSV.GZ file](../glossary.md#tsvgz-extensions)) and a corresponding
JSON file for storing metadata fields (see below).

!!! example "Example datasets"

      [Example datasets](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-examples/#dataset-index)
      with physiological data have been formatted using this specification
      and can be used for practical guidance when curating a new dataset:

      -   [`7t_trt`](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples/tree/master/7t_trt)
      -   [`ds210`](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples/tree/master/ds210)

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/[ses-<label>/]
    <datatype>/
        <matches>[_recording-<label>]_physio.tsv.gz
        <matches>[_recording-<label>]_physio.json
```

For the template directory name, `<datatype>` can correspond to any data
recording modality, for example `func`, `anat`, `dwi`, `meg`, `eeg`, `ieeg`,
or `beh`.

In the template filenames, the `<matches>` part corresponds to task filename
before the suffix.
For example for the file `sub-control01_task-nback_run-1_bold.nii.gz`,
`<matches>` would correspond to `sub-control01_task-nback_run-1`.

!!! warning "Caution"

    `<matches>_physio.tsv.gz` files MUST NOT include a header line, as established by the
    [common-principles](../common-principles.md#compressed-tabular-files).
    As a result, when supplying a `<matches>_physio.tsv.gz` file, an accompanying
    `<matches>_physio.json` MUST be present to indicate the column names.

The [`recording-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#recording)
entity MAY be used to distinguish between several recording files.
For example `sub-01_task-bart_recording-eyetracking_physio.tsv.gz` to contain
the eyetracking data in a certain sampling frequency, and
`sub-01_task-bart_recording-breathing_physio.tsv.gz` to contain respiratory
measurements in a different sampling frequency.

Physiological recordings (including eyetracking) MUST use the `_physio` suffix.

The following tables specify metadata fields for the `*_physio.json` file.

Additional metadata may be included as in
[any TSV file](../common-principles.md#tabular-files) to specify, for
example, the units of the recorded time series.

Example `*_physio.tsv.gz`:

{{ MACROS___make_filetree_example(

   "sub-control01": {
      "func": {
         "sub-control01_task-nback_physio.tsv.gz": "",
         },
      },
   }

```

Example `*_physio.json`:

<!-- This block generates a file tree.
A guide for using macros can be found at
 https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/blob/master/macros_doc.md
-->
{{ MACROS___make_filetree_example(
   {
   "sub-control01": {
      "func": {
         "sub-control01_task-nback_physio.json": "",
         },
      },
   }
) }}

```JSON
{
    "SamplingFrequency": 100.0,
    "StartTime": -22.345,
    "Columns": ["cardiac", "respiratory", "trigger"],
    "Manufacturer": "Brain Research Equipment ltd.",
    "cardiac": {
        "Description": "continuous pulse measurement",
        "Units": "mV"
        },
    "respiratory": {
        "Description": "continuous measurements by respiration belt",
        "Units": "mV"
        },
    "trigger": {
        "Description": "continuous measurement of the scanner trigger signal"
        }
}
```

Note how apart from the general metadata fields like `SamplingFrequency`, `StartTime`, `Columns`,
and `Manufacturer`,
each individual column in the TSV file may be documented as its own field in the JSON file
(identical to the practice in other TSV+JSON file pairs).
Here, only the `Description` and `Units` fields are shown, but you may use any other of the
[defined fields](../common-principles.md#tabular-files) such as `TermURL`, `LongName`, and so on.
In this example, the `"cardiac"` and `"respiratory"` time series are produced by devices from
the same manufacturer and follow the same sampling frequency.
To specify different sampling frequencies or manufacturers, the time series would have to be split
into separate files like `*_recording-cardiac_physio.<tsv.gz|json>` and `*_recording-respiratory_physio.<tsv.gz|json>`.

## Recommendations for specific use cases

To store pulse or breathing measurements, or the scanner trigger signal, the
following naming conventions SHOULD be used for the column names:

<!-- This block generates a columns table.
The definitions of these fields can be found in
  src/schema/rules/tabular_data/*.yaml
and a guide for using macros can be found at
 https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/blob/master/macros_doc.md
-->
{{ MACROS___make_columns_table("physio.PhysioColumns") }}

For any other data to be specified in columns, the column names can be chosen
as deemed appropriate by the researcher.

Recordings with different sampling frequencies or starting times should be
stored in separate files
(and the [`recording-<label>`](../appendices/entities.md#recording)
entity MAY be used to distinguish these files).

For motion parameters acquired from MRI scanner side motion correction, the
`_physio` suffix MUST be used.

For multi-echo data, a given `physio.tsv` file is applicable to all echos of
a particular run.

   "sub-01": {
      "func": {
        "sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_physio.tsv.gz": "",
        "sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_echo-1_bold.nii.gz": "",
        "sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_echo-2_bold.nii.gz": "",
        "sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_echo-3_bold.nii.gz": "",
         },
      },
   }
) }}
