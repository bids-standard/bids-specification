# The Brain Imaging Data Structure

This site serves as an online resource to see the current state of the
Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) specification. It contains information
about the core specification, as well as many modality-specific extensions.

To get started, [check out the introduction](01-introduction.md). If you'd like
more information on how to adapt your own datasets to match the BIDS
specification, we recommend exploring the [bids-specification starter kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit).

For an overview of the BIDS ecosystem, visit the [BIDS homepage](https://bids.neuroimaging.io).
