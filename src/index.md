# The Brain Imaging Data Structure

This resource defines the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) specification, including the the core specification as well as many modality-specific extensions.

To get started, [check out the introduction](01-introduction.md). If you'd like
more information on how to adapt your own datasets to match the BIDS
specification, we recommend exploring the [bids-specification starter kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit).

For an overview of the BIDS ecosystem, visit the [BIDS homepage](https://bids.neuroimaging.io).
