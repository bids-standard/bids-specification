# BIDS Extension Proposals

The BIDS specification can be extended in a backwards compatible way and will
evolve over time.
This is accomplished with BIDS Extension Proposals (BEPs),
which are community-driven processes (see [BEP guidelines](https://bids-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).

On the [BIDS homepage](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) you can find a
[list of extension proposals](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/get_involved.html#extending-the-bids-specification)
that are currently being worked on.

All changes that are **not** backwards compatible with the current BIDS
specification will be implemented in BIDS `2.0`.
See the corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-2-devel).
