```

### `README`

In addition a free form text file (`README`) describing the dataset in more
details SHOULD be provided. The `README` file MUST be either in ASCII or UTF-8
encoding.

### `CHANGES`

Version history of the dataset (describing changes, updates and corrections) MAY
be provided in the form of a `CHANGES` text file. This file MUST follow the CPAN
Changelog convention:
[http://search.cpan.org/~haarg/CPAN-Changes-0.400002/lib/CPAN/Changes/Spec.pod](https://metacpan.org/pod/release/HAARG/CPAN-Changes-0.400002/lib/CPAN/Changes/Spec.pod).
The `CHANGES` file MUST be either in ASCII or UTF-8 encoding.

Example:

```Text
1.0.1 2015-08-27
 - Fixed slice timing information.

1.0.0 2015-08-17
 - Initial release.
```

## Participants file

Template:

```Text
participants.tsv
participants.json
phenotype/<measurement_tool_name>.tsv
phenotype/<measurement_tool_name>.json
```

Optional: Yes

The purpose of this file is to describe properties of participants such as age,
handedness, sex, etc. In case of single session studies this file has one
compulsory column `participant_id` that consists of `sub-<label>`,
followed by a list of optional columns describing participants. Each participant
needs to be described by one and only one row.

`participants.tsv` example:

```Text
participant_id  age sex group
sub-control01 34  M control
sub-control02 12  F control
sub-patient01 33  F patient
```

## Phenotypic and assessment data

If the dataset includes multiple sets of participant level measurements (for
example responses from multiple questionnaires) they can be split into
individual files separate from `participants.tsv`.

Each of the measurement files MUST be kept in a `/phenotype` directory placed
at the root of the BIDS dataset and MUST end with the `.tsv` extension.
File names SHOULD be chosen to reflect the contents of the file.
For example, the "Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale" could be saved in a file
called `/phenotype/acds_adult.tsv`.

The files can include an arbitrary set of columns, but one of them MUST be
`participant_id` and the entries of that column MUST correspond to the subjects
in the BIDS dataset and `participants.tsv` file.

As with all other tabular data, the additional phenotypic information files
MAY be accompanied by a JSON file describing the columns in detail
(see [Tabular files](02-common-principles.md#tabular-files)).
In addition to the column description, a section describing the measurement tool
(as a whole) MAY be added under the name `MeasurementToolMetadata`.
This section consists of two keys:

  - `Description`: A free text description of the measurement tool
  - `TermURL`: A link to an entity in an ontology corresponding to this tool.

As an example, consider the contents of a file called
`phenotype/acds_adult.json`:

```JSON
{
  "MeasurementToolMetadata": {
    "Description": "Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale V1.2",
    "TermURL": "http://www.cognitiveatlas.org/task/id/trm_5586ff878155d"
  },
  "adhd_b": {
    "Description": "B. CHILDHOOD ONSET OF ADHD (PRIOR TO AGE 7)",
    "Levels": {
      "1": "YES",
      "2": "NO"
    }
  },
  "adhd_c_dx": {
    "Description": "As child met A, B, C, D, E and F diagnostic criteria",
    "Levels": {
      "1": "YES",
      "2": "NO"
    }
  }
}
```

Please note that in this example `MeasurementToolMetadata` includes information
about the questionnaire and `adhd_b` and `adhd_c_dx` correspond to individual
columns.

In addition to the keys available to describe columns in all tabular files
(`LongName`, `Description`, `Levels`, `Units`, and `TermURL`) the
`participants.json` file as well as phenotypic files can also include column
descriptions with a `Derivative` field that, when set to true, indicates that
values in the corresponding column is a transformation of values from other
columns (for example a summary score based on a subset of items in a
questionnaire).

## Scans file

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/[ses-<label>/]
    sub-<label>[_ses-<label>]_scans.tsv
```

Optional: Yes

The purpose of this file is to describe timing and other properties of each
imaging acquisition sequence (each run `.nii[.gz]` file) within one session.
Each `.nii[.gz]` file should be described by at most one row. Relative paths to
files should be used under a compulsory `filename` header. If acquisition time
is included it should be under `acq_time` header. Datetime should be expressed
in the following format `2009-06-15T13:45:30` (year, month, day, hour (24h),
minute, second; this is equivalent to the RFC3339 "date-time" format, time zone
is always assumed as local time). For anonymization purposes all dates within
one subject should be shifted by a randomly chosen (but common across all runs
etc.) number of days. This way relative timing would be preserved, but chances
of identifying a person based on the date and time of their scan would be
decreased. Dates that are shifted for anonymization purposes should be set to a
year 1925 or earlier to clearly distinguish them from unmodified data. Shifting
dates is RECOMMENDED, but not required.

Additional fields can include external behavioral measures relevant to the
scan. For example vigilance questionnaire score administered after a resting
state scan.

Example:

```Text
filename  acq_time
func/sub-control01_task-nback_bold.nii.gz 1877-06-15T13:45:30
func/sub-control01_task-motor_bold.nii.gz 1877-06-15T13:55:33
```

## Code

Template: `code/*`

Source code of scripts that were used to prepare the dataset (for example if it
was anonymized or defaced) MAY be stored here.<sup>1</sup> Extra care should be
taken to avoid including original IDs or any identifiable information with the
source code. There are no limitations or recommendations on the language and/or
code organization of these scripts at the moment.

<sup>1</sup>Storing actual source files with the data is preferred over links to
external source repositories to maximize long term preservation (which would
suffer if an external repository would not be available anymore).
