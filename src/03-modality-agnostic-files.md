#### Derived dataset and pipeline description

As for any BIDS dataset, a `dataset_description.json` file MUST be found at the
top level of the a derived dataset:
`<dataset>/derivatives/<pipeline_name>/dataset_description.json`

In addition to the keys for raw BIDS datasets,
derived BIDS datasets include the following REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED
`dataset_description.json` keys:

{{ MACROS___make_metadata_table(
   {
      "GeneratedBy": "REQUIRED",
      "SourceDatasets": "RECOMMENDED",
   }
) }}

Each object in the `GeneratedBy` list includes the following REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED
and OPTIONAL keys:

| **Key name** | **Requirement level** | **Data type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name         | REQUIRED              | [string][]    | Name of the pipeline or process that generated the outputs. Use `"Manual"` to indicate the derivatives were generated by hand, or adjusted manually after an initial run of an automated pipeline.        |
| Version      | RECOMMENDED           | [string][]    | Version of the pipeline.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Description  | OPTIONAL              | [string][]    | Plain-text description of the pipeline or process that generated the outputs. RECOMMENDED if `Name` is `"Manual"`.                                                                                        |
| CodeURL      | OPTIONAL              | [string][]    | URL where the code used to generate the derivatives may be found.                                                                                                                                         |
| Container    | OPTIONAL              | [object][]    | Used to specify the location and relevant attributes of software container image used to produce the derivative. Valid keys in this object include `Type`, `Tag` and [`URI`][uri] with [string][] values. |

Example:

```JSON
{
  "Name": "FMRIPREP Outputs",
  "BIDSVersion": "1.4.0",
  "DatasetType": "derivative",
  "GeneratedBy": [
    {
      "Name": "fmriprep",
      "Version": "1.4.1",
      "Container": {
        "Type": "docker",
        "Tag": "poldracklab/fmriprep:1.4.1"
        }
    },
    {
      "Name": "Manual",
      "Description": "Re-added RepetitionTime metadata to bold.json files"
    }
  ],
  "SourceDatasets": [
    {
      "DOI": "doi:10.18112/openneuro.ds000114.v1.0.1",
      "URL": "https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000114/versions/1.0.1",
      "Version": "1.0.1"
    }
  ]
}
```

If a derived dataset is stored as a subfolder of the raw dataset, then the `Name` field
of the first `GeneratedBy` object MUST be a substring of the derived dataset folder name.
That is, in a directory `<dataset>/derivatives/<pipeline>[-<variant>]/`, the first
`GeneratedBy` object should have a `Name` of `<pipeline>`.

### `README`

Every BIDS dataset SHOULD come with a free form text file (`README`) describing the dataset in more detail.
The `README` file MUST be either in ASCII or UTF-8 encoding.
A guideline for creating a good `README` file can be found in the
[bids-starter-kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/blob/master/templates/README).

### `CHANGES`

Version history of the dataset (describing changes, updates and corrections) MAY
be provided in the form of a `CHANGES` text file. This file MUST follow the
[CPAN Changelog convention](https://metacpan.org/pod/release/HAARG/CPAN-Changes-0.400002/lib/CPAN/Changes/Spec.pod).
The `CHANGES` file MUST be either in ASCII or UTF-8 encoding.

Example:

```Text
1.0.1 2015-08-27
  - Fixed slice timing information.

1.0.0 2015-08-17
  - Initial release.
```

### `LICENSE`

A `LICENSE` file MAY be provided in addition to the short specification of the
used license in the `dataset_description.json` `"License"` field.
The `"License"` field and `LICENSE` file MUST correspond.
The `LICENSE` file MUST be either in ASCII or UTF-8 encoding.

## Participants file

Template:

```Text
participants.tsv
participants.json
```

The purpose of this RECOMMENDED file is to describe properties of participants
such as age, sex, handedness, species and strain.
If this file exists, it MUST contain the column `participant_id`,
which MUST consist of `sub-<label>` values identifying one row for each participant,
followed by a list of optional columns describing participants.
Each participant MUST be described by one and only one row.

The RECOMMENDED `species` column SHOULD be a binomial species name from the
[NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi)
(for examples `homo sapiens`, `mus musculus`, `rattus norvegicus`).
For backwards compatibility, if `species` is absent, the participant is assumed to be
`homo sapiens`.

Commonly used *optional* columns in `participants.tsv` files are `age`, `sex`,
`handedness`, `strain` and `strain_rrid`. We RECOMMEND to make use
of these columns, and in case that you do use them, we RECOMMEND to use the
following values for them:

-   `age`: numeric value in years (float or integer value)

-   `sex`: string value indicating phenotypical sex, one of "male", "female",
    "other"

    -   for "male", use one of these values: `male`, `m`, `M`, `MALE`, `Male`

    -   for "female", use one of these values: `female`, `f`, `F`, `FEMALE`,
        `Female`

    -   for "other", use one of these values: `other`, `o`, `O`, `OTHER`,
        `Other`

-   `handedness`: string value indicating one of "left", "right",
    "ambidextrous"

    -   for "left", use one of these values: `left`, `l`, `L`, `LEFT`, `Left`

    -   for "right", use one of these values: `right`, `r`, `R`, `RIGHT`,
        `Right`

    -   for "ambidextrous", use one of these values: `ambidextrous`, `a`, `A`,
        `AMBIDEXTROUS`, `Ambidextrous`

-   `strain`: for species different from `homo sapiens`, string value indicating
    the strain of the species, for example: `C57BL/6J`.

-   `strain_rrid`: for species different from `homo sapiens`, research resource identifier
    ([RRID](https://scicrunch.org/resources/Organisms/search)) of the strain of the species,
    for example: `RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664`.

Throughout BIDS you can indicate missing values with `n/a` (for "not
available").

`participants.tsv` example:

```Text
participant_id age sex handedness group
sub-01 34 M right read
sub-02 12 F right write
sub-03 33 F n/a read
```

It is RECOMMENDED to accompany each `participants.tsv` file with a sidecar
`participants.json` file to describe the TSV column names and properties of their values (see also
the [section on tabular files](02-common-principles.md#tabular-files)).
Such sidecar files are needed to interpret the data, especially so when
optional columns are defined beyond `age`, `sex`, `handedness`, `species`, `strain`,
and `strain_rrid`, such as `group` in this example, or when a different
age unit is needed (for example, gestational weeks).
If no `units` is provided for age, it will be assumed to be in years relative
to date of birth.

`participants.json` example:

```JSON
{
    "age": {
        "Description": "age of the participant",
        "Units": "years"
    },
    "sex": {
        "Description": "sex of the participant as reported by the participant",
        "Levels": {
            "M": "male",
            "F": "female"
        }
    },
    "handedness": {
        "Description": "handedness of the participant as reported by the participant",
        "Levels": {
            "left": "left",
            "right": "right"
        }
    },
    "group": {
        "Description": "experimental group the participant belonged to",
        "Levels": {
            "read": "participants who read an inspirational text before the experiment",
            "write": "participants who wrote an inspirational text before the experiment"
        }
    }
}
```

## Samples file

Template:

```Text
samples.tsv
samples.json
```

The purpose of this file is to describe properties of samples, indicated by the `sample` entity.
This file is REQUIRED if `sample-<label>` is present in any file name within the dataset.
If this file exists, it MUST contain the three following columns:

-   `sample_id`: MUST consist of `sample-<label>` values identifying one row
    for each sample

-   `participant_id`: MUST consist of `sub-<label>`

-   `sample_type`: MUST consist of sample type values, either `cell line`, `in vitro differentiated cells`,
    `primary cell`, `cell-free sample`, `cloning host`, `tissue`, `whole organisms`, `organoid` or
    `technical sample` from [ENCODE Biosample Type](https://www.encodeproject.org/profiles/biosample_type)

Other optional columns MAY be used to describe the samples.
Each sample MUST be described by one and only one row.

Commonly used *optional* columns in `samples.tsv` files are `pathology` and
`derived_from`. We RECOMMEND to make use of these columns, and in case that
you do use them, we RECOMMEND to use the following values for them:

-   `pathology`: string value describing the pathology of the sample or type of control.
    When different from `healthy`, pathology SHOULD be specified in `samples.tsv`.
    The pathology MAY instead be specified in [Sessions files](./03-modality-agnostic-files.md#sessions-file)
    in case it changes over time.

-   `derived_from`: `sample-<label>` key/value pair from which a sample is derived from,
    for example a slice of tissue (`sample-02`) derived from a block of tissue (`sample-01`),
    as illustrated in the example below.

`samples.tsv` example:

```Text
sample_id participant_id sample_type derived_from
sample-01 sub-01 tissue n/a
sample-02 sub-01 tissue sample-01
sample-03 sub-01 tissue sample-01
sample-04 sub-02 tissue n/a
sample-05 sub-02 tissue n/a
```

It is RECOMMENDED to accompany each `samples.tsv` file with a sidecar
`samples.json` file to describe the TSV column names and properties of their values
(see also the [section on tabular files](02-common-principles.md#tabular-files)).

`samples.json` example:

```JSON
{
    "sample_type": {
        "Description": "type of sample from ENCODE Biosample Type (https://www.encodeproject.org/profiles/biosample_type)",
    },
    "derived_from": {
        "Description": "sample_id from which the sample is derived"
    }
}
```

## Phenotypic and assessment data

Template:

```Text
phenotype/
    <measurement_tool_name>.tsv
    <measurement_tool_name>.json
```

Optional: Yes

If the dataset includes multiple sets of participant level measurements (for
example responses from multiple questionnaires) they can be split into
individual files separate from `participants.tsv`.

Each of the measurement files MUST be kept in a `/phenotype` directory placed
at the root of the BIDS dataset and MUST end with the `.tsv` extension.
File names SHOULD be chosen to reflect the contents of the file.
For example, the "Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale" could be saved in a file
called `/phenotype/acds_adult.tsv`.

The files can include an arbitrary set of columns, but one of them MUST be
`participant_id` and the entries of that column MUST correspond to the subjects
in the BIDS dataset and `participants.tsv` file.

As with all other tabular data, the additional phenotypic information files
MAY be accompanied by a JSON file describing the columns in detail
(see [Tabular files](02-common-principles.md#tabular-files)).

In addition to the column descriptions, the JSON file MAY contain the following fields:

{{ MACROS___make_metadata_table(
   {
      "MeasurementToolMetadata": "OPTIONAL",
   }
) }}

As an example, consider the contents of a file called
`phenotype/acds_adult.json`:

```JSON
{
  "MeasurementToolMetadata": {
    "Description": "Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale V1.2",
    "TermURL": "https://www.cognitiveatlas.org/task/id/trm_5586ff878155d"
  },
  "adhd_b": {
    "Description": "B. CHILDHOOD ONSET OF ADHD (PRIOR TO AGE 7)",
    "Levels": {
      "1": "YES",
      "2": "NO"
    }
  },
  "adhd_c_dx": {
    "Description": "As child met A, B, C, D, E and F diagnostic criteria",
    "Levels": {
      "1": "YES",
      "2": "NO"
    }
  }
}
```

Please note that in this example `MeasurementToolMetadata` includes information
about the questionnaire and `adhd_b` and `adhd_c_dx` correspond to individual
columns.

In addition to the keys available to describe columns in all tabular files
(`LongName`, `Description`, `Levels`, `Units`, and `TermURL`) the
`participants.json` file as well as phenotypic files can also include column
descriptions with a `Derivative` field that, when set to true, indicates that
values in the corresponding column is a transformation of values from other
columns (for example a summary score based on a subset of items in a
questionnaire).

## Scans file

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/
    [ses-<label>/]
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>]_scans.tsv
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>]_scans.json
```

Optional: Yes

The purpose of this file is to describe timing and other properties of each
imaging acquisition sequence (each *run* file) within one session.

Each neural recording *file* SHOULD be described by exactly one row.
Some recordings consist of multiple parts, that span several files,
for example through `echo-`, `part-`, or `split-` entities.
Such recordings MUST be documented with one row per file.

Relative paths to files should be used under a compulsory `filename` header.

If acquisition time is included it should be listed under the `acq_time` header.
Acquisition time refers to when the first data point in each run was acquired.
Furthermore, if this header is provided, the acquisition times of all files that
belong to a recording MUST be identical.

Datetime should be expressed as described in [Units](./02-common-principles.md#units).

For anonymization purposes all dates within one subject should be shifted by a
randomly chosen (but consistent across all recordings) number of days.
This way relative timing would be preserved, but chances of identifying a
person based on the date and time of their scan would be decreased.
Dates that are shifted for anonymization purposes SHOULD be set to the year 1925
or earlier to clearly distinguish them from unmodified data.
Shifting dates is RECOMMENDED, but not required.

Additional fields can include external behavioral measures relevant to the
scan.
For example vigilance questionnaire score administered after a resting
state scan.
All such included additional fields SHOULD be documented in an accompanying
`_scans.json` file that describes these fields in detail
(see [Tabular files](02-common-principles.md#tabular-files)).

Example `_scans.tsv`:

```Text
filename	acq_time
func/sub-control01_task-nback_bold.nii.gz	1877-06-15T13:45:30
func/sub-control01_task-motor_bold.nii.gz	1877-06-15T13:55:33
meg/sub-control01_task-rest_split-01_meg.nii.gz	1877-06-15T12:15:27
meg/sub-control01_task-rest_split-02_meg.nii.gz	1877-06-15T12:15:27
```

## Sessions file

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/
    sub-<label>_sessions.tsv
```

Optional: Yes

In case of multiple sessions there is an option of adding additional
`sessions.tsv` files describing variables changing between sessions.
In such case one file per participant SHOULD be added.
These files MUST include a `session_id` column and describe each session by one and only one row.
Column names in `sessions.tsv` files MUST be different from group level participant key column names in the
[`participants.tsv` file](./03-modality-agnostic-files.md#participants-file).

`_sessions.tsv` example:

```Text
session_id	acq_time	systolic_blood_pressure
ses-predrug	2009-06-15T13:45:30	120
ses-postdrug	2009-06-16T13:45:30	100
ses-followup	2009-06-17T13:45:30	110
```

## Code

Template: `code/*`

Source code of scripts that were used to prepare the dataset MAY be stored here.
Examples include anonymization or defacing of the data, or
the conversion from the format of the source data to the BIDS format
(see [source vs. raw vs. derived data](./02-common-principles.md#source-vs-raw-vs-derived-data)).
Extra care should be taken to avoid including original IDs or
any identifiable information with the source code.
There are no limitations or recommendations on the language and/or
code organization of these scripts at the moment.
