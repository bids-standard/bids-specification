# Data summary files

## Participants file

Template:

```Text
participants.tsv
participants.json
```

<!-- This block generates a description.

{{ MACROS___render_text("objects.files.participants.description") }}

We RECOMMEND to make use of these columns, and
in case that you do use them, we RECOMMEND to use the following values
for them:

{{ MACROS___make_columns_table("modality_agnostic.Participants") }}

Throughout BIDS you can indicate missing values with `n/a` (for "not
available").

`participants.tsv` example:

```tsv
participant_id	age	sex	handedness	group
sub-01	34	M	right	read
sub-02	12	F	right	write
sub-03	33	F	n/a	read
```

It is RECOMMENDED to accompany each `participants.tsv` file with a sidecar
`participants.json` file to describe the TSV column names and properties of their values (see also
the [section on tabular files](../common-principles.md#tabular-files)).
Such sidecar files are needed to interpret the data, especially so when
optional columns are defined beyond `age`, `sex`, `handedness`, `species`, `strain`,
and `strain_rrid`, such as `group` in this example, or when a different
age unit is needed (for example, gestational weeks).
If no `units` is provided for age, it will be assumed to be in years relative
to date of birth.

`participants.json` example:

```JSON
{
    "age": {
        "Description": "age of the participant",
        "Units": "year"
    },
    "sex": {
        "Description": "sex of the participant as reported by the participant",
        "Levels": {
            "M": "male",
            "F": "female"
        }
    },
    "handedness": {
        "Description": "handedness of the participant as reported by the participant",
        "Levels": {
            "left": "left",
            "right": "right"
        }
    },
    "group": {
        "Description": "experimental group the participant belonged to",
        "Levels": {
            "read": "participants who read an inspirational text before the experiment",
            "write": "participants who wrote an inspirational text before the experiment"
        }
    }
}
```

## Samples file

Template:

```Text
samples.tsv
samples.json
```

<!-- This block generates a description.
A guide for using macros can be found at
 https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/blob/master/macros_doc.md

{{ MACROS___render_text("objects.files.samples.description") }}

<!-- This block generates a columns table.

  src/schema/rules/tabular_data/*.yaml
and a guide for using macros can be found at
 https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/blob/master/macros_doc.md
-->
{{ MACROS___make_columns_table("modality_agnostic.Samples") }}

`samples.tsv` example:

```tsv
sample_id	participant_id	sample_type	derived_from
sample-01	sub-01	tissue	n/a
sample-02	sub-01	tissue	sample-01
sample-03	sub-01	tissue	sample-01
sample-04	sub-02	tissue	n/a
sample-05	sub-02	tissue	n/a
```

It is RECOMMENDED to accompany each `samples.tsv` file with a sidecar
`samples.json` file to describe the TSV column names and properties of their values
(see also the [section on tabular files](../common-principles.md#tabular-files)).

`samples.json` example:

```JSON
{
    "sample_type": {
        "Description": "type of sample from ENCODE Biosample Type (https://www.encodeproject.org/profiles/biosample_type)",
    },
    "derived_from": {
        "Description": "sample_id from which the sample is derived"
    }
}
```

## Scans file

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/
    [ses-<label>/]
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>]_scans.tsv
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>]_scans.json
```

Optional: Yes

The purpose of this file is to describe timing and other properties of each recording *file* within one session.
In general, each of these files SHOULD be described by exactly one row.

For *file formats* that are based on several files of different extensions,
or a directory of files with different extensions (multi-file file formats),
only that file SHOULD be listed that would also be passed to analysis software for reading the data.
For example for BrainVision data (`.vhdr`, `.vmrk`, `.eeg`),
only the `.vhdr` SHOULD be listed;
for EEGLAB data (`.set`, `.fdt`),
only the `.set` file SHOULD be listed;
and for CTF data (`.ds`),
the whole `.ds` directory SHOULD be listed,
and not the individual files in that directory.

Some neural recordings consist of multiple parts,
that span several files,
but that share the same extension.
For example in [entity-linked file collections](../common-principles.md#entity-linked-file-collections),
commonly used for qMRI,
where recordings may be linked through entities such as `echo` and `part`
(using `.nii` or `.nii.gz` extensions).
For another example consider the case of large files in `.fif` format that are linked through the `split` entity
(see [Split files](../appendices/meg-file-formats.md#split-files)).
Such recordings MUST be documented with one row per file
(unlike the case of multi-file file formats described above).

-->
{{ MACROS___make_columns_table("modality_agnostic.Scans") }}

Additional fields can include external behavioral measures relevant to the
scan.
For example vigilance questionnaire score administered after a resting
state scan.
All such included additional fields SHOULD be documented in an accompanying
`_scans.json` file that describes these fields in detail
(see [Tabular files](../common-principles.md#tabular-files)).

Example `_scans.tsv`:

```tsv
filename	acq_time
func/sub-control01_task-nback_bold.nii.gz	1877-06-15T13:45:30
func/sub-control01_task-motor_bold.nii.gz	1877-06-15T13:55:33
meg/sub-control01_task-rest_split-01_meg.nii.gz	1877-06-15T12:15:27
meg/sub-control01_task-rest_split-02_meg.nii.gz	1877-06-15T12:15:27
```

## Sessions file

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/
    sub-<label>_sessions.tsv
```

Optional: Yes

In case of multiple sessions there is an option of adding additional
`sessions.tsv` files describing variables changing between sessions.
In such case one file per participant SHOULD be added.
These files MUST include a `session_id` column and describe each session by one and only one row.
Column names in `sessions.tsv` files MUST be different from group level participant key column names in the
[`participants.tsv` file](./data-summary-files.md#participants-file).

{{ MACROS___make_columns_table("modality_agnostic.Sessions") }}

`_sessions.tsv` example:

```tsv
session_id	acq_time	systolic_blood_pressure
ses-predrug	2009-06-15T13:45:30	120
ses-postdrug	2009-06-16T13:45:30	100
ses-followup	2009-06-17T13:45:30	110
