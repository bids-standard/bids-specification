# Magnetic Resonance Imaging

## Common metadata fields

MR Data described in the following sections share the following RECOMMENDED metadata
fields (stored in sidecar JSON files). MRI acquisition parameters are divided
into several categories based on

Corresponds to DICOM Tag 0018, 1250 `Receive Coil Name`, although not all vendors populate that DICOM Tag, in which case this field can be derived from an appropriate private DICOM field                                      |
| ReceiveCoilActiveElements     | RECOMMENDED           | [string][]    | Information describing the active/selected elements of the receiver coil. This doesn't correspond to a tag in the DICOM ontology. The vendor-defined terminology for active coil elements can go in this field. See an example below the table.                           |
| GradientSetType               | RECOMMENDED           | [string][]    | It should be possible to infer the gradient coil from the scanner model. If not, for example because of a custom upgrade or use of a gradient insert set, then the specifications of the actual gradient coil should be reported independently                            |
| MRTransmitCoilSequence        | RECOMMENDED           | [string][]    | This is a relevant field if a non-standard transmit coil is used.

| MatrixCoilMode                | RECOMMENDED           | [string][]    | (If used) A method for reducing the number of independent channels by combining in analog the signals from multiple coil elements. There are typically different default modes when using un-accelerated or accelerated (for example, GRAPPA, SENSE) imaging              |
| CoilCombinationMethod         | RECOMMENDED           | [string][]    | Almost all fMRI studies using phased-array coils use root-sum-of-squares (rSOS) combination, but other methods exist. The image reconstruction is changed by the coil combination method (as for the matrix coil mode above), so anything non-standard should be reported |

Example for `ReceiveCoilActiveElements`:

For Siemens, coil channels are typically not activated/selected individually,
but rather in pre-defined selectable "groups" of individual channels,
and the list of the "groups" of elements that are active/selected in any
given scan populates the `Coil String` entry in Siemens' private DICOM fields
(for example, `HEA;HEP` for the Siemens standard 32 ch coil
when both the anterior and posterior groups are activated).
This is a flexible field that can be used as most appropriate for a given
vendor and coil to define the "active" coil elements.
Since individual scans can sometimes not have the intended coil elements selected,
it is preferable for this field to be populated directly from the DICOM
for each individual scan, so that it can be used as a mechanism for checking
that a given scan was collected with the intended coil elements selected

| PhaseEncodingDirection         | RECOMMENDED           | [string][]    | Possible values: `i`, `j`, `k`, `i-`, `j-`, `k-`. The letters `i`, `j`, `k` correspond to the first, second and third axis of the data in the NIFTI file. The polarity of the phase encoding is assumed to go from zero index to maximum index unless `-` sign is present (then the order is reversed - starting from the highest index instead of zero). `PhaseEncodingDirection` is defined as the direction along which phase is was modulated which may result in visible distortions. Note that this is not the same as the DICOM term `InPlanePhaseEncodingDirection` which can have `ROW` or `COL` values. This parameter is REQUIRED if corresponding fieldmap data is present or when using multiple runs with different phase encoding directions (which can be later used for field inhomogeneity correction). |
| EffectiveEchoSpacing           | RECOMMENDED           | [number][]    | The "effective" sampling interval, specified in seconds, between lines in the phase-encoding direction, defined based on the size of the reconstructed image in the phase direction. It is frequently, but incorrectly, referred to as "dwell time" (see `DwellTime` parameter below for actual dwell time). It is required for unwarping distortions using field maps. Note that beyond just in-plane acceleration, a variety of other manipulations to the phase encoding need to be accounted for properly, including partial fourier, phase oversampling, phase resolution, phase field-of-view and interpolation.<sup>2</sup> This parameter is REQUIRED if corresponding fieldmap data is present.                                                                                                                  |
| TotalReadoutTime               | RECOMMENDED           | [number][]    | This is actually the "effective" total readout time , defined as the readout duration, specified in seconds, that would have generated data with the given level of distortion. It is NOT the actual, physical duration of the readout train. If `EffectiveEchoSpacing` has been properly computed, it is just `EffectiveEchoSpacing * (ReconMatrixPE - 1)`.<sup>3</sup> . This parameter is REQUIRED if corresponding "field/distortion" maps acquired with opposing phase encoding directions are present (see 8.9.4).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

<sup>2</sup>Conveniently, for Siemens data, this value is easily obtained as
`1 / (BWPPPE * ReconMatrixPE)`, where BWPPPE is the
"BandwidthPerPixelPhaseEncode" in DICOM tag (0019,1028) and ReconMatrixPE is
the size of the actual reconstructed data in the phase direction (which is NOT
reflected in a single DICOM tag for all possible aforementioned scan
manipulations). See [here](https://lcni.uoregon.edu/kb-articles/kb-0003) and
[here](https://github.com/neurolabusc/dcm_qa/tree/master/In/TotalReadoutTime)

<sup>3</sup>We use the time between the center of the first "effective" echo
and the center of the last "effective" echo, sometimes called the "FSL definition".

| SliceTiming            | RECOMMENDED, but REQUIRED for sparse sequences that do not have the `DelayTime` field set                        | [array][] of [numbers][] | The time at which each slice was acquired within each volume (frame) of the acquisition. Slice timing is not slice order -- rather, it is a list of times containing the time (in seconds) of each slice acquisition in relation to the beginning of volume acquisition. The list goes through the slices along the slice axis in the slice encoding dimension (see below). Note that to ensure the proper interpretation of the `SliceTiming` field, it is important to check if the OPTIONAL `SliceEncodingDirection` exists. In particular, if `SliceEncodingDirection` is negative, the entries in `SliceTiming` are defined in reverse order with respect to the slice axis, such that the final entry in the `SliceTiming` list is the time of acquisition of slice 0. Without this parameter slice time correction will not be possible. |
| SliceEncodingDirection | RECOMMENDED                                                                                                      | [string][]               | Possible values: `i`, `j`, `k`, `i-`, `j-`, `k-` (the axis of the NIfTI data along which slices were acquired, and the direction in which `SliceTiming` is defined with respect to). `i`, `j`, `k` identifiers correspond to the first, second and third axis of the data in the NIfTI file. A `-` sign indicates that the contents of `SliceTiming` are defined in reverse order - that is, the first entry corresponds to the slice with the largest index, and the final entry corresponds to slice index zero. When present, the axis defined by `SliceEncodingDirection` needs to be consistent with the ‘slice_dim' field in the NIfTI header. When absent, the entries in `SliceTiming` must be in the order of increasing slice index as defined by the NIfTI header.                                                                   |
| DwellTime              | RECOMMENDED                                                                                                      | [number][]               | Actual dwell time (in seconds) of the receiver per point in the readout direction, including any oversampling. For Siemens, this corresponds to DICOM field (0019,1018) (in ns). This value is necessary for the optional readout distortion correction of anatomicals in the HCP Pipelines. It also usefully provides a handle on the readout bandwidth, which isn't captured in the other metadata tags. Not to be confused with `EffectiveEchoSpacing`, and the frequent mislabeling of echo spacing (which is spacing in the phase encoding direction) as "dwell time" (which is spacing in the readout direction).                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

If the structural images included in the dataset were defaced (to protect
identity of participants) one MAY provide the binary mask that was used to
remove facial features in the form of `_defacemask` files.
In such cases,  the OPTIONAL [`mod-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#mod)
key/value pair corresponds to modality suffix,
such as T1w or inplaneT1, referenced by the defacemask image.
For example, `sub-01_mod-T1w_defacemask.nii.gz`.

If several scans of the same modality are acquired they MUST be indexed with the
[`run-<index>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#run) key-value pair:
`_run-1`, `_run-2`, `_run-3`, and so on (only nonnegative integers are allowed as
run labels). When there is only one scan of a given type the run key MAY be
omitted. Please note that diffusion imaging data is stored elsewhere (see
below).

The OPTIONAL [`acq-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#acq)
key/value pair corresponds to a custom label the user
MAY use to distinguish a different set of parameters used for acquiring the same
modality. For example this should be used when a study includes two T1w images -
one full brain low resolution and and one restricted field of view but high
resolution. In such case two files could have the following names:
`sub-01_acq-highres_T1w.nii.gz` and `sub-01_acq-lowres_T1w.nii.gz`, however the
user is free to choose any other label than `highres` and `lowres` as long as
they are consistent across subjects and sessions. In case different sequences
are used to record the same modality (for example, RARE and FLASH for T1w) this field
can also be used to make that distinction. At what level of detail to make the
distinction (for example, just between RARE and FLASH, or between RARE, FLASH, and
FLASHsubsampled) remains at the discretion of the researcher.

Similarly the OPTIONAL [`ce-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#ce)
key/value can be used to distinguish
sequences using different contrast enhanced images. The label is the name of the
contrast agent. The key `ContrastBolusIngredient` MAY be also be added in the
JSON file, with the same label.

Some meta information about the acquisition MAY be provided in an additional
JSON file. See [Common metadata fields](#common-metadata-fields) for a
list of terms and their definitions. There are also some OPTIONAL JSON
fields specific to anatomical scans:

| **Key name**            | **Requirement level** | **Data type** | **Description**                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ContrastBolusIngredient | OPTIONAL              | [string][]    | Active ingredient of agent. Values MUST be one of: IODINE, GADOLINIUM, CARBON DIOXIDE, BARIUM, XENON Corresponds to DICOM Tag 0018,1048. |

Similarly, the OPTIONAL [`rec-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#rec)
key/value can be used to distinguish
different reconstruction algorithms (for example ones using motion correction).

## Task (including resting state) imaging data

Currently supported image contrasts include:

| **Name**  | `contrast_label` | **Description**                                                                                      |
|---------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BOLD      | bold             | Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent contrast (specialized T2\* weighting)                                   |
| CBV       | cbv              | Cerebral Blood Volume contrast (specialized T2\* weighting or difference between T1 weighted images) |
| Phase     | phase            | Phase information associated with magnitude information stored in BOLD contrast                      |

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/[ses-<label>/]
    func/
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>]_task-<label>[_acq-<label>][_ce-<label>][_dir-<label>][_rec-<label>][_run-<index>][_echo-<index>]_<contrast_label>.nii[.gz]
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>]_task-<label>[_acq-<label>][_ce-<label>][_dir-<label>][_rec-<label>][_run-<index>][_echo-<index>]_sbref.nii[.gz]
```

Functional imaging consists of techniques that support rapid temporal repetition.
This includes but is not limited to task based fMRI
as well as resting state fMRI, which is treated like any other task. For task
based fMRI a corresponding task events file (see below) MUST be provided
(please note that this file is not necessary for resting state scans). For
multiband acquisitions, one MAY also save the single-band reference image as
type `sbref` (for example, `sub-control01_task-nback_sbref.nii.gz`).

Each task has a unique label that MUST only consist of letters and/or numbers
(other characters, including spaces and underscores, are not allowed) with the
[`task-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#task) key/value pair.
Those labels MUST be consistent across subjects and sessions.

If more than one run of the same task has been acquired the
[`run-<index>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#run) key/value pair MUST be used:
`_run-1`, `_run-2`, `_run-3`, and so on. If only one run was acquired the
`run-<index>` can be omitted. In the context of functional imaging a run is
defined as the same task, but in some cases it can mean different set of stimuli
(for example randomized order) and participant responses.

The OPTIONAL [`acq-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#acq)
key/value pair corresponds to a custom label one may
use to distinguish different set of parameters used for acquiring the same task.
For example this should be used when a study includes two resting state images -
one single band and one multiband. In such case two files could have the
following names: `sub-01_task-rest_acq-singleband_bold.nii.gz` and
`sub-01_task-rest_acq-multiband_bold.nii.gz`, however the user is MAY choose any
other label than `singleband` and `multiband` as long as they are consistent
across subjects and sessions and consist only of the legal label characters.

Similarly the OPTIONAL [`ce-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#ce)
key/value can be used to distinguish
sequences using different contrast enhanced images. The label is the name of the
contrast agent. The key ContrastBolusIngredient MAY be also be added in the JSON
file, with the same label.

Similarly the OPTIONAL [`rec-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#rec)
key/value can be used to distinguish
different reconstruction algorithms (for example ones using motion correction).

Similarly the OPTIONAL [`dir-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#dir)
and [`rec-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#rec) key/values
can be used to distinguish different phase-encoding directions and
reconstruction algorithms (for example ones using motion correction).
See [`fmap` Case 4](01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.md#case-4-multiple-phase-encoded-directions-pepolar)
for more information on `dir` field specification.

Multi-echo data MUST be split into one file per echo using the
[`echo-<index>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#echo) key-value pair. For example:

```Text
sub-01/
   func/
      sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_echo-1_bold.nii.gz
      sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_echo-1_bold.json
      sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_echo-2_bold.nii.gz
      sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_echo-2_bold.json
      sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_echo-3_bold.nii.gz
      sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_echo-3_bold.json
```

Please note that the `<index>` denotes the number/index (in the form of a
nonnegative integer) of the echo not the echo time value which needs to be stored in the
field EchoTime of the separate JSON file.

Some meta information about the acquisition MUST be provided in an additional
JSON file.

### Required fields

| **Key name**   | **Requirement level** | **Data type**            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RepetitionTime | REQUIRED              | [number][]               | The time in seconds between the beginning of an acquisition of one volume and the beginning of acquisition of the volume following it (TR). Please note that this definition includes time between scans (when no data has been acquired) in case of sparse acquisition schemes. This value needs to be consistent with the `pixdim[4]` field (after accounting for units stored in `xyzt_units` field) in the NIfTI header. This field is mutually exclusive with `VolumeTiming` and is derived from DICOM Tag 0018, 0080 and converted to seconds. |
| VolumeTiming   | REQUIRED              | [array][] of [numbers][] | The time at which each volume was acquired during the acquisition. It is described using a list of times referring to the onset of each volume in the BOLD series. The list must have the same length as the BOLD series, and the values must be non-negative and monotonically increasing. This field is mutually exclusive with `RepetitionTime` and `DelayTime`. If defined, this requires acquisition time (TA) be defined via either `SliceTiming` or `AcquisitionDuration` be defined.                                                         |
| TaskName       | REQUIRED              | [string][]               | Name of the task. No two tasks should have the same name. The task label included in the file name is derived from this TaskName field by removing all non-alphanumeric (`[a-zA-Z0-9]`) characters. For example TaskName `faces n-back` will correspond to task label `facesnback`. A RECOMMENDED convention is to name resting state task using labels beginning with `rest`.                                                                                                                                                                       |

For the fields described above and in the following section, the term "Volume"
refers to a reconstruction of the object being imaged (for example, brain or part of a
brain). In case of multiple channels in a coil, the term "Volume" refers to a
combined image rather than an image from each coil.

For example, a sequence that automatically discards the first 4 volumes before saving would have this field as 4. A sequence that doesn't discard dummy scans would have this set to 0. Please note that the onsets recorded in the \_event.tsv file should always refer to the beginning of the acquisition of the first volume in the corresponding imaging file - independent of the value of `NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByScanner` field. |
| NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByUser    | RECOMMENDED                                                                                                                                                                                        | [integer][]   | Number of volumes ("dummy scans") discarded by the user before including the file in the dataset. If possible, including all of the volumes is strongly recommended. Please note that the onsets recorded in the \_event.tsv file should always refer to the beginning of the acquisition of the first volume in the corresponding imaging file - independent of the value of `NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByUser` field.                                                                                                                                                                       |

If the field is not present it is assumed to be set to zero. Corresponds to Siemens CSA header field `lDelayTimeInTR`. This field is REQUIRED for sparse sequences using the `RepetitionTime` field that do not have the `SliceTiming` field set to allowed for accurate calculation of "acquisition time". This field is mutually exclusive with `VolumeTiming`.                                                                                                                               |
| AcquisitionDuration               | RECOMMENDED, but REQUIRED for sequences that are described with the `VolumeTiming` field and that do not have the `SliceTiming` field set to allow for accurate calculation of "acquisition time"  | [number][]    | Duration (in seconds) of volume acquisition. Corresponds to DICOM Tag 0018,9073 `Acquisition Duration`. This field is mutually exclusive with `RepetitionTime`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

This delay is commonly caused by adjustments and loading times. This specification is entirely independent of `NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByScanner` or `NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByUser`, as the delay precedes the acquisition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The following table recapitulates the different ways that specific fields have
to be populated for functional sequences. Note that all these options can be
used for non sparse sequences but that only options B, D and E are valid for
sparse sequences.

#### fMRI task information

| **Key name**    | **Requirement level** | **Data type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Instructions    | RECOMMENDED           | [string][]    | Text of the instructions given to participants before the scan. This is especially important in context of resting state fMRI and distinguishing between eyes open and eyes closed paradigms. |
| TaskDescription | RECOMMENDED           | [string][]    | Longer description of the task.                                                                                                                                                               |
| CogAtlasID      | RECOMMENDED           | [string][]    | [URI][uri] of the corresponding [Cognitive Atlas](https://www.cognitiveatlas.org/) Task term.                                                                                                 |
| CogPOID         | RECOMMENDED           | [string][]    | [URI][uri] of the corresponding [CogPO](http://www.cogpo.org/) term.                                                                                                                          |

See [Common metadata fields](#common-metadata-fields) for a list of
additional terms and their definitions.

Example:

```Text
sub-control01/
    func/
        sub-control01_task-nback_bold.json
```

```JSON
{
   "TaskName": "N Back",
   "RepetitionTime": 0.8,
   "EchoTime": 0.03,
   "FlipAngle": 78,
   "SliceTiming": [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6],
   "MultibandAccelerationFactor": 4,
   "ParallelReductionFactorInPlane": 2,
   "PhaseEncodingDirection": "j",
   "InstitutionName": "Stanford University",
   "InstitutionAddress": "450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305-2004, USA",
   "DeviceSerialNumber": "11035"
}
```

If this information is the same for all participants, sessions and runs it can
be provided in `task-<label>_bold.json` (in the root directory of the
dataset). However, if the information differs between subjects/runs it can be
specified in the
`sub-<label>/func/sub-<label>_task-<label>[_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_bold.json` file.
If both files are specified fields from the file corresponding to a particular
participant, task and run takes precedence.

## Diffusion imaging data

Diffusion-weighted imaging data acquired for a participant.
Currently supported image types include:

| **Name**              | `suffix` | **Description**                                                   |
|---------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DWI                   | dwi      | Diffusion-weighted imaging contrast (specialized T2\* weighting). |
| Single-Band Reference | sbref    | Single-band reference for one or more multi-band `dwi` images.    |

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/[ses-<label>/]
    dwi/
       sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_dir-<label>][_run-<index>]_dwi.nii[.gz]
       sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_dir-<label>][_run-<index>]_dwi.bval
       sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_dir-<label>][_run-<index>]_dwi.bvec
       sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_dir-<label>][_run-<index>]_dwi.json
       sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_dir-<label>][_run-<index>]_sbref.nii[.gz]
       sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_dir-<label>][_run-<index>]_sbref.json
```

If more than one run of the same acquisition and direction has been acquired, the
[`run-<index>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#run) key/value pair MUST be used:
`_run-1`, `_run-2`, `_run-3` (and so forth.)
When there is only one scan of a given acquisition and direction, the run key MAY be
omitted.
The [`run-<index>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#run) key/value pair is RECOMMENDED
to encode the splits of multipart DWI scans (see [below](#multipart-split-dwi-schemes).)

The OPTIONAL [`acq-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#acq)
key/value pair corresponds to a custom label the user may use to
distinguish different sets of parameters.

The OPTIONAL [`dir-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#dir)
key/value pair corresponds to a custom label the user may use to
distinguish different sets of phase-encoding directions.

**Combining multi- and single-band acquisitions**.
The single-band reference image MAY be stored with suffix `sbref` (for example,
`dwi/sub-control01_sbref.nii[.gz]`) as long as the image has no corresponding
[gradient information (`[*_]dwi.bval` and `[*_]dwi.bvec` sidecar files)](#required-gradient-orientation-information)
to be stored.

Otherwise, if some gradient information is associated to the single-band diffusion
image and a multi-band diffusion image also exists, the `acq-<label>` key/value pair
MUST be used to distinguish both images.
In such a case, two files could have the following names:
`sub-01_acq-singleband_dwi.nii.gz` and `sub-01_acq-multiband_dwi.nii.gz`.
The user is free to choose any other label than `singleband` and
`multiband`, as long as they are consistent across subjects and sessions.

### REQUIRED gradient orientation information

The REQUIRED gradient orientation information corresponding to a DWI acquisition
MUST be stored using `[*_]dwi.bval` and `[*_]dwi.bvec` pairs of files.
The `[*_]dwi.bval` and `[*_]dwi.bvec` files MAY be saved on any level of the directory structure
and thus define those values for all sessions and/or subjects in one place (see
[the inheritance principle](../02-common-principles.md#the-inheritance-principle)).

As an exception to the [common principles](../02-common-principles.md#definitions)
that parameters are constant across runs, the gradient table information (stored
within the `[*_]dwi.bval` and `[*_]dwi.bvec` files) MAY change across DWI runs.

**Gradient orientation file formats**.
The `[*_]dwi.bval` and `[*_]dwi.bvec` files MUST follow the
[FSL format](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FDT/UserGuide#DTIFIT):
The `[*_]dwi.bvec` file contains 3 rows with *N* space-delimited floating-point numbers
(corresponding to the *N* volumes in the corresponding NIfTI file.)
The first row contains the *x* elements, the second row contains the *y* elements and
the third row contains the *z* elements of a unit vector in the direction of the applied
diffusion gradient, where the *i*-th elements in each row correspond together to
the *i*-th volume, with `[0,0,0]` for *non-diffusion-weighted* (also called *b*=0 or *low-b*)
volumes.
Following the FSL format for the `[*_]dwi.bvec` specification, the coordinate system of
the *b* vectors MUST be defined with respect to the coordinate system defined by
the header of the corresponding `_dwi` NIfTI file and not the scanner's device
coordinate system (see [Coordinate systems](../99-appendices/08-coordinate-systems.md)).
The most relevant implication for this choice is that any rotations applied to the DWI data
also need to be applied to the *b* vectors in the `[*_]dwi.bvec` file.

Example of `[*_]dwi.bvec` file, with *N*=6, with two *b*=0 volumes in the beginning:

```Text
0 0 0.021828 -0.015425 -0.70918 -0.2465
0 0 0.80242 0.22098 -0.00063106 0.1043
0 0 -0.59636 0.97516 -0.70503 -0.96351
```

The `[*_]dwi.bval` file contains the *b*-values (in s/mm<sup>2</sup>) corresponding to the
volumes in the relevant NIfTI file), with 0 designating *b*=0 volumes, space-delimited.

Example of `[*_]dwi.bval` file, corresponding to the previous `[*_]dwi.bvec` example:

```Text
0 0 2000 2000 1000 1000
```

### Multipart (split) DWI schemes

Some MR schemes cannot be acquired directly by some scanner devices,
requiring to generate several DWI runs that were originally meant to belong
in a single one.
For instance, some GE scanners cannot collect more than &asymp;160 volumes
in a single run under fast-changing gradients, so acquiring *HCP-style*
diffusion images will require splitting the DWI scheme in several runs.
Because researchers will generally optimize the data splits, these will likely
not be able to be directly concatenated.
BIDS permits defining arbitrary groupings of these multipart scans with the
following metadata:

| **Key name**    | **Requirement level** | **Data type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MultipartID     | REQUIRED              | [string][]    | A unique (per participant) label tagging DWI runs that are part of a multipart scan.                                                                                                                                 |

JSON example:

```JSON
{
  "MultipartID": "dwi_1"
}
```

For instance, if there are two phase-encoding directions (`AP`, `PA`), and
two runs each, and the intent of the researcher is that all of them are
part of a unique multipart scan, then they will tag all four runs with the
same `MultipartID` (shown at the right-hand side of the file listing):

```Text
sub-<label>/[ses-<label>/]         # MultipartID
  dwi/
    sub-1_dir-AP_run-1_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_1
    sub-1_dir-AP_run-2_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_1
    sub-1_dir-PA_run-1_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_1
    sub-1_dir-PA_run-2_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_1
```

If, conversely, the researcher wanted to store two multipart scans, one possibility
is to combine matching phase-encoding directions:

```Text
sub-<label>/[ses-<label>/]         # MultipartID
  dwi/
    sub-1_dir-AP_run-1_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_1
    sub-1_dir-AP_run-2_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_1
    sub-1_dir-PA_run-1_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_2
    sub-1_dir-PA_run-2_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_2
```

Alternatively, the researcher's intent could be combining opposed phase-encoding
runs instead:

```Text
sub-<label>/[ses-<label>/]         # MultipartID
  dwi/
    sub-1_dir-AP_run-1_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_1
    sub-1_dir-AP_run-2_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_2
    sub-1_dir-PA_run-1_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_1
    sub-1_dir-PA_run-2_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_2
```

The `MultipartID` metadata MAY be used with the
[`acq-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#acq) key/value pair, for example:

```Text
sub-<label>/[ses-<label>/]             # MultipartID
  dwi/
    sub-1_acq-shell1_run-1_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_1
    sub-1_acq-shell1_run-2_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_2
    sub-1_acq-shell2_run-1_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_1
    sub-1_acq-shell2_run-2_dwi.nii.gz  # dwi_2
```

### Other RECOMMENDED metadata

The `PhaseEncodingDirection` and `TotalReadoutTime` metadata
fields are RECOMMENDED to enable the correction of geometrical distortions
with [fieldmap information](#fieldmap-data).
See [Common metadata fields](#common-metadata-fields) for a list of

The complete ASL time series should be stored as a 4D NIfTI file in the original acquisition order, accompanied by two ancillary 
files: `*_asl.json` and `*_aslcontext.tsv`. The `*_asl.nii.gz` and `*_m0scan.nii.gz` should contain appropriately scaled data and no scaling factors 
should be stored in the ancillary files or in the NIfTI header. 

The `m0scan` can either be stored inside the 4D ASL time-series NIfTI file or as a separate NIfTI file, depending on whether it 
was acquired within the ASL time-series or as a separate scan. These and other M0 options are specified in the required `M0` field of the `*_asl.json` file. 
It can also be stored under `fmap/sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_ce-<label>]_dir-<label>[_run-<index>]_m0scan.nii[.gz]`, 
when the pepolar approach is used.

### `*_aslcontext.tsv`
The `*_aslcontext.tsv` lists the volume_type for each volume in a single column, in the `*_asl.nii[.gz]`, corresponding to the volume_types specified in the table below, based 
on DICOM Tag (0018,9257) `ASL Context`. Note that the volume_types `control` and  `label` within BIDS do not discriminate between types of labeling, but only serve to specify 
the magnetization state of the blood and thus the ASL subtraction order.

| **volume_type** | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| control         | The control image is acquired in the exact same way as the label image, except that the magnetization of the blood flowing into the imaging region has not been inverted.              |
| label           | The label image is acquired in the exact same way as the control image, except that the blood magnetization flowing into the imaging region has been inverted.                         |
| m0scan          | The M0 image is a calibration image, used to estimate the equilibrium magnetization of blood.                                                                                          |
| deltam          | The deltaM image is a perfusion-weighted image, obtained by the subtraction of `control` - `label`.                                                                                    |
| cbf             | The cerebral blood flow (CBF) image is produced by dividing the deltaM by the M0, quantified into `mL/100g/min` (See also [doi:10.1002/mrm.25197](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.25197)). |

If the `control` and `label` images are not available, their derivative `deltam` should be stored within the `*_asl.nii[.gz]` and specified in the `*_aslcontext.tsv` instead. If 
the `deltam` is not available, `cbf` should be stored within the `*_asl.nii[.gz]` and specified in the `*_aslcontext.tsv`. When `cbf` is stored within the `*_asl.nii[.gz]`, its 
units need to be specified in the `*_asl.json` as well. See below examples of these cases, in order of decreasing preference.

#### Case 1: `*_asl.nii[.gz]` consists of volume_types `control`, `label`

In most cases, the ASL timeseries, provided by the scanner, consist of a series of `control` and `label`, and optionally `m0scan`, volumes. In this case, only the `control`, 
`label`, and optionally `m0scan` volumes should be stored in the `*_asl.json`, and the exact volume_type series should be specified in the `*_aslcontext.tsv`. The optional 
`deltam` or `cbf` volumes should be stored and specified as derivative. Example of `*_aslcontext.tsv`:

| volume_type |
|-------------|
| control     |
| label       |
| control     |
| label       |
| [m0scan]    |

#### Case 2: `*_asl.nii[.gz]` consists of volume_types `deltam` (scanner does not export `control` or `label` volumes)

In some cases, `control` and `label` volumes are lacking within the acquired ASL timeseries, but the intermediate `deltam` - and optionally a `m0scan` - volume is 
reconstructed/exported by the scanner. In this case, the `deltam` should be included in the `*_asl.nii[.gz]` and specified in the `*_aslcontext.tsv`. An optional `cbf` volume 
should be stored and specified as derivative. Example of `*_aslcontext.tsv`:

| volume_type |
|-------------|
| deltam      |
| [m0scan]    |

#### Case 3: `*_asl.nii[.gz]` consists of volume_type `cbf` (scanner does not export `control`, `label`, or `deltaM` volumes) 

If `control` and `label` or intermediate ASL volumes are not reconstructed or exported, but a pre-calculated `cbf` - and optionally a `m0scan` - volume is provided by the
scanner, the `cbf` should be included in the `*_asl.nii[.gz]` and specified in the `*_aslcontext.tsv`. Example of `*_aslcontext.tsv`:

| volume_type |
|-------------|
| cbf         |
| [m0scan]    |

### `*_asl.json` file

Depending on the method used for ASL acquisition (i.e. (P)CASL or PASL) different metadata fields are applicable.

#### Common metadata fields applicable to both (P)CASL and PASL

| SliceTiming                       | RECOMMENDED, but REQUIRED in case of a 2D acquisition, or when `VolumeTiming` is defined                                          | [array][] of [numbers][]                | The time at which each slice was acquired within each volume (frame) of the acquisition with respect to the beginning of volume acquisition, namely after the `PostLabelingDelay`. In the case of 3D acquisition, a zero is entered. The length of this array of numbers should be equal to the number of slices for 2D acquisition, with the first time being zero, effectively equal to the `PostLabelingDelay`. Slice timing is not the same as slice order. Rather, it is a list of times containing the time (in seconds) of each slice acquisition in relation to the beginning of volume acquisition. The list goes through the slices along the slice axis in the slice encoding dimension. Note that to ensure the proper interpretation of the `SliceTiming` field, it is important to check if the OPTIONAL `SliceEncodingDirection` exists. In particular, if `SliceEncodingDirection` is negative, the entries in `SliceTiming` are defined in reverse order with respect to the slice axis, such that the final entry in the `SliceTiming` list is the time of acquisition of slice zero. |

Otherwise, use the `VolumeTiming` field instead. This field is derived from DICOM Tag 0018, 0080.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Use this field instead of the `RepetitionTime` field in the case that the ASL time series have a non-uniform time distance between acquired volumes. The list must have the same length as the `*_aslcontext.tsv`, and the numbers must be non-negative and monotonically increasing. If `VolumeTiming` is defined, this requires acquisition time (TA) to be defined via `AcquisitionDuration`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Fieldmap data

Data acquired to correct for *B<sub>0</sub>* inhomogeneities can come in different forms.
The current version of this standard considers four different scenarios:

 1. [Phase-difference map](#case-1-phase-difference-map-and-at-least-one-magnitude-image)
 1. [Two phase maps](#case-2-two-phase-maps-and-two-magnitude-images)
 1. [Direct *field mapping*](#case-3-direct-field-mapping)
 1. ["*PEpolar*" fieldmaps](#case-4-multiple-phase-encoded-directions-pepolar)

These four different types of field mapping strategies can be encoded
using the following image types:

| **Name**         | `suffix`         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Magnitude        | magnitude\[1,2\] | Field-mapping MR schemes such as gradient-recalled echo (GRE) generate a Magnitude image to be used for anatomical reference. Requires the existence of Phase, Phase-difference or Fieldmap maps.                    |
| Phase            | phase{1,2}       | Phase map generated by GRE or similar schemes, each associated with the first (`phase1`) or second (`phase2`) echoes in the sequence.                                                                                |
| Phase-difference | phasediff        | Some scanners subtract the `phase1` from the `phase2` map and generate a unique `phasediff` file. For instance, this is a common output for the built-in fieldmap sequence of Siemens scanners.                      |
| Fieldmap         | fieldmap         | Some MR schemes such as spiral-echo (SE) sequences are able to directly provide maps of the *B<sub>0</sub>* field inhomogeneity.                                                                                     |
| EPI              | epi              | The phase-encoding polarity (PEpolar) technique combines two or more Spin Echo EPI scans with different phase encoding directions to estimate the underlying inhomogeneity/deformation map.                          |

Two OPTIONAL entities, following more general rules of the specification,
are allowed across all the four scenarios:

  - The OPTIONAL [`run-<index>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#run) key/value pair corresponds to a one-based index
    to distinguish multiple fieldmaps with the same parameters.

  - The OPTIONAL [`acq-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#acq) key/value pair corresponds to a custom label
    the user may use to distinguish different set of parameters.

### Types of fieldmaps

#### Case 1: Phase-difference map and at least one magnitude image

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/[ses-<label>/]
    fmap/
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_phasediff.nii[.gz]

        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_magnitude2.nii[.gz]  # OPTIONAL
```

where
the REQUIRED `_phasediff` image corresponds to the phase-drift map between echo times,
the REQUIRED `_magnitude1` image corresponds to the shorter echo time, and
the OPTIONAL `_magnitude2` image to the longer echo time.

Required fields:

`sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_phasediff.json`
MUST define the time of two echos used to map the phase and finally calculate
the phase-difference map.
For example:

```JSON
{
   "EchoTime1": 0.00600,
   "EchoTime2": 0.00746
}
```

#### Case 2: Two phase maps and two magnitude images
Similar to case 1, but instead of a precomputed phase-difference map, two
separate phase images and two magnitude images corresponding to first and
second echos are available.

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/[ses-<label>/]
    fmap/
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_phase1.nii[.gz]
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_phase1.json
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_phase2.nii[.gz]
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_phase2.json
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_magnitude1.nii[.gz]
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_magnitude2.nii[.gz]
```

Required fields:

| **Key name**   | **Requirement level** | **Data type**            | **Description**                                                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EchoTime       | REQUIRED              | [number][]               | The time (in seconds) when the echo corresponding to this phase map was acquired. |

Each phase map has a corresponding sidecar JSON file to specify its corresponding `EchoTime`.
For example, `sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_phase2.json` may read:

```JSON
{
   "EchoTime": 0.00746
}
```

#### Case 3: Direct *field mapping*
In some cases (for example GE), the scanner software will directly reconstruct a
*B<sub>0</sub>* field map along with a magnitude image used for anatomical reference.

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/[ses-<label>/]
    fmap/
       sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_magnitude.nii[.gz]
       sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_fieldmap.nii[.gz]
       sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_fieldmap.json
```

Required fields:

| **Key name**   | **Requirement level** | **Data type**            | **Description**                                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Units          | REQUIRED              | [string][]               | Units of the fieldmap: Hertz (`Hz`), Radians per second (`rad/s`), or Tesla (`T`). |

For example:

```JSON
{
   "Units": "rad/s",
   "IntendedFor": "func/sub-01_task-motor_bold.nii.gz"
}
```

See [Using `IntendedFor` metadata](#using-intendedfor-metadata)
for details on the `IntendedFor` field.

#### Case 4: Multiple phase encoded directions ("pepolar")
The phase-encoding polarity (PEpolar) technique combines two or more Spin Echo
EPI scans with different phase encoding directions to estimate the distortion
map corresponding to the nonuniformities of the *B<sub>0</sub>* field.
These `_epi.nii[.gz]` - or _m0scan.nii[.gz] for arterial spin labeling perfusion data - files can be 3D or 4D --
in the latter case, all timepoints share the same scanning parameters.
Examples of software tools using these kinds of images are FSL TOPUP,
AFNI `3dqwarp`, and SPM.

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/[ses-<label>/]
    fmap/
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_ce-<label>]_dir-<label>[_run-<index>]_epi.nii[.gz]
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_ce-<label>]_dir-<label>[_run-<index>]_epi.json
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_ce-<label>]_dir-<label>[_run-<index>]_m0scan.nii[.gz]
        sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>][_ce-<label>]_dir-<label>[_run-<index>]_m0scan.json
```

The [`dir-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#dir) entity is REQUIRED
for these files.
This key-value pair MUST be used in addition to
the REQUIRED `PhaseEncodingDirection` metadata field
(see [File name structure](../02-common-principles.md#file-name-structure)).

Required fields:

| **Key name**           | **Requirement level** | **Data type** | **Description**                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PhaseEncodingDirection | REQUIRED              | [string][]    | See [in-plane spatial encoding](#in-plane-spatial-encoding) table of fields.       |
| TotalReadoutTime       | REQUIRED              | [number][]    | See [in-plane spatial encoding](#in-plane-spatial-encoding) table of fields.       |

For example:

```JSON
{
   "PhaseEncodingDirection": "j-",
   "TotalReadoutTime": 0.095,
   "IntendedFor": "func/sub-01_task-motor_bold.nii.gz"
}
```

See [Using `IntendedFor` metadata](#using-intendedfor-metadata)
for details on the `IntendedFor` field.

As for other EPI sequences, these field mapping sequences may have any of the
[in-plane spatial encoding](#in-plane-spatial-encoding) metadata keys.
However, please note that `PhaseEncodingDirection` and `TotalReadoutTime` keys
are REQUIRED for these field mapping sequences.

### Expressing the MR protocol intent for fieldmaps

Fieldmaps are typically acquired with the purpose of correcting one or more EPI
scans under `func/` or `dwi/` for distortions derived from *B<sub>0</sub>*
nonuniformity.
This linking between fieldmaps and their targetted data MAY be encoded with the
`IntendedFor` metadata.

#### Using `IntendedFor` metadata

Fieldmap data MAY be linked to the specific scan(s) it was acquired for by
filling the `IntendedFor` field in the corresponding JSON file.

| **Key name** | **Requirement level** | **Data type**                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IntendedFor  | RECOMMENDED           | [string][] or [array][] of [string][] | Contains one or more filenames with paths relative to the participant subfolder. The path needs to use forward slashes instead of backward slashes. This field is OPTIONAL, and in case the fieldmaps do not correspond to any particular scans, it does not have to be filled. |

For example:

```JSON
{
   "IntendedFor": [
        "ses-pre/func/sub-01_ses-pre_task-motor_run-1_bold.nii.gz",
        "ses-pre/func/sub-01_ses-pre_task-motor_run-2_bold.nii.gz"
    ]
}
```
