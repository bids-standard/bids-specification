# Electroencephalography (EEG)

Support for EEG was developed as a [BIDS Extension Proposal](../06-extensions.md#bids-extension-proposals).
Please cite the following paper when referring to this part of the standard in
context of the academic literature:

The following example EEG datasets have been formatted using this specification
and can be used for practical guidance when curating a new dataset.

-   Single session per subject: [`eeg_matchingpennies`](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/CJ2DR)
-   Multiple sessions per subject: [`eeg_rishikesh`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1490922)
-   Combined with fMRI: [`eeg_rest_fmri`](https://osf.io/94c5t/files/)

Further datasets are available from the [BIDS examples repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples).

The EEG community uses a variety of formats for storing raw data, and there is
no single standard that all researchers agree on. For BIDS, EEG data MUST be
stored in one of the following formats:

-   [European data format](https://www.edfplus.info/) (`.edf`)

-   [BrainVision Core Data Format](https://www.brainproducts.com/productdetails.php?id=21&tab=5)
    (`.vhdr`, `.vmrk`, `.eeg`) by Brain Products GmbH

-   The format used by the MATLAB toolbox [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab)
    (`.set` and `.fdt` files)

-   [Biosemi](https://www.biosemi.com/) data format (`.bdf`)

It is RECOMMENDED to use the European data format, or the BrainVision data
format. It is furthermore discouraged to use the other accepted formats over
these RECOMMENDED formats, particularly because there are conversion scripts
available in most commonly used programming languages to convert data into the
RECOMMENDED formats. The data in their original format, if different from the
supported formats, can be stored in the [`/sourcedata` directory](../02-common-principles.md#source-vs-raw-vs-derived-data).

The original data format is especially valuable in case conversion elicits the
loss of crucial metadata specific to manufacturers and specific EEG systems. We
also encourage users to provide additional meta information extracted from the
manufacturer specific data files in the sidecar JSON file. Other relevant files
MAY be included alongside the original EEG data in `/sourcedata`.

Note the RecordingType, which depends on whether the data stream on disk is interrupted or not. Continuous data is by definition 1 segment without interruption. Epoched data consists of multiple segments that all have the same length (e.g., corresponding to trials) and that have gaps in between. Discontinuous data consists of multiple segments of different length, for example due to a pause in the acquisition.

Note that for proper documentation of EEG recording metadata it is important to
understand the difference between electrode and channel: An EEG electrode is
attached to the skin, whereas a channel is the combination of the analog
differential amplifier and analog-to-digital converter that result in a
potential (voltage) difference that is stored in the EEG dataset. We employ
the following short definitions:

-   Electrode = A single point of contact between the acquisition system and
    the recording site (e.g., scalp, neural tissue, ...). Multiple electrodes
    can be organized as caps (for EEG), arrays, grids, leads, strips, probes,
    shafts, etc.

-   Channel = A single analog-to-digital converter in the recording system that
    regularly samples the value of a transducer, which results in the signal
    being represented as a time series in the digitized data. This can be
    connected to two electrodes (to measure the potential difference between
    them), a magnetic field or magnetic gradient sensor, temperature sensor,
    accelerometer, etc.

Although the *reference* and *ground* electrodes are often referred to as
channels, they are in most common EEG systems not recorded by
themselves. Therefore they are not represented as channels in the data.
The type of referencing for all channels and optionally the location of
the reference electrode and the location of the ground electrode MAY
be specified.

## Channels description (`*_channels.tsv`)

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/
    [ses-<label>]/
      eeg/
        [sub-<label>[_ses-<label>]_task-<label>[_run-<index>]_channels.tsv]
```

This file is RECOMMENDED as it provides easily searchable information across
BIDS datasets for e.g., general curation, response to queries or batch
analysis.
The required columns are channel `name`, `type` and `units` in this specific
order.
To avoid confusion, the channels SHOULD be listed in the order they
appear in the EEG data file.
Any number of additional columns may be added to provide additional information
about the channels.
Note that electrode positions SHOULD NOT be added to this file, but to [`*_electrodes.tsv`](./03-electroencephalography.md#electrodes-description-_electrodestsv).

The columns of the Channels description table stored in `*_channels.tsv` are:

electrode position recording device, or repeated digitization before and after
the recording.

        [sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>]_coordsystem.json]
```

A `*_coordsystem.json` file is used to specify the fiducials, the location of
anatomical landmarks, and the coordinate system and units in which the position
of electrodes and landmarks is expressed. **The `*_coordsystem.json` is
REQUIRED if the optional `*_electrodes.tsv` is specified**. If a corresponding
anatomical MRI is available, the locations of landmarks and fiducials according
to that scan should also be stored in the [`*_T1w.json`](./01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.md)
file which goes alongside the MRI data.

For disambiguation, we employ the following definitions for fiducials and
anatomical landmarks respectively:

-   Fiducials = objects with a well defined location used to facilitate the
    localization of electrodes and co-registration with other geometric data
    such as the participant's own T1 weighted magnetic resonance head image, a
    T1 weighted template head image, or a spherical head model. Commonly used
    fiducials are vitamin-E pills, which show clearly in an MRI, or reflective
    spheres that are localized with an infrared optical tracking system.

-   Anatomical landmarks = locations on a research subject such as the nasion,
    which is the intersection of the frontal bone and two nasal bones of the
    human skull.

Fiducials are typically used in conjunction with anatomical landmarks. An
example would be the placement of vitamin-E pills on top of anatomical
landmarks, or the placement of LEDs on the nasion and preauricular points to
triangulate the position of other LED-lit electrodes on a research subject's
head.

If the position of anatomical landmarks is measured using the same system or
device used to measure electrode positions, and if thereby the anatomical
landmarks are expressed in the same coordinates, the coordinates of the
anatomical landmarks can be specified in `electrodes.tsv`. The same applies to
the coordinates of the fiducials.

Anatomical landmarks or fiducials measured on an anatomical MRI  that match the
landmarks or fiducials during an EEG session/run, must be stored separately in
the corresponding `*_T1w.json` or `*_T2w.json` file and should be expressed in
voxels (starting from `[0, 0, 0]`).

Example:

```JSON
{
  "IntendedFor":"/sub-01/ses-01/anat/sub-01_T1w.nii",
  "EEGCoordinateSystem":"Other",
  "EEGCoordinateUnits":"mm",
  "EEGCoordinateSystemDescription":"RAS orientation: Origin halfway between LPA and RPA, positive x-axis towards RPA, positive y-axis orthogonal to x-axis through Nasion,  z-axis orthogonal to xy-plane, pointing in superior direction.",
  "FiducialsDescription":"Electrodes and fiducials were digitized with Polhemus, fiducials were recorded as the centre of vitamin E capsules sticked on the left/right pre-auricular and on the nasion, these are also visible on the T1w MRI"
}
```

## Landmark photos (`*_photo.jpg`)

Photos of the anatomical landmarks and/or fiducials.

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/
    [ses-<label>]/
      eeg/
        [sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label>]_photo.jpg]
```

Photos of the anatomical landmarks and/or fiducials are OPTIONAL.
Please note that the photos may need to be cropped or blurred to conceal
identifying features prior to sharing, depending on the terms of the consent
given by the participant.

The `acq` parameter can be used to indicate acquisition of different photos of
the same face (or other body part in different angles to show, for example, the
location of the nasion (NAS) as opposed to the right periauricular point (RPA).

Example:

actual anatomical nasion: `sub-0001_ses-001_acq-NAS_photo.jpg`
