# Motion

Support for Motion was developed as a
[BIDS Extension Proposal](../07-extensions.md#bids-extension-proposals).
Please see [Citing BIDS](../01-introduction.md#citing-bids)
on how to appropriately credit this extension when referring to it in the
context of the academic literature.

Several [example Motion datasets](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples)
have been formatted using this specification
and can be used for practical guidance when curating a new dataset.

A wide variety of motion capture systems are used in human research, resulting in
different native data formats. The current BEP specifically
deals with positions, orientations, and their time derivatives. For camera-based
motion capture the raw camera footage falls out of scope. To share motion data
recorded using an optical system, only the position or orientation output is
formatted in BIDS, not the input camera footage.

The extension is not limited to motion data in physical space but also encompasses
simulated movement in virtual space, as far as these are comparable to movements
in physical space. The extension is also not limited to the positions/orientations
of human body parts, other dynamic objects (physical or virtual) in the environment
whose motion is tracked may be included as additional indications of motion.

For the current BEP, motion data MUST be stored in a `*_motion.tsv` file. A tracking system is defined as a group of tracking devices that share hardware properties (same recording device) and/or software properties (for example same sampling rates). For example if the position of multiple optical markers is processed via one recording unit, this would be defined as a tracking system. Note that it is not uncommon to have multiple tracking systems to record at the same time. Each tracking system should have its own `*[tracksys-<label>]_motion.tsv` file. One column per channel per tracking system is intended in the `*[tracksys-<label>]_motion.tsv` file. The header of each column should correspond to one entry in a `*_channels.tsv` file. All relevant metadata about a tracking systems is stored in the sidecar `*_motion.json` file in the subfield trackingsystem. The data from each tracking system in their original format, if different from `.tsv`, can be stored in the [`/sourcedata` directory](../02-common-principles.md#source-vs-raw-vs-derived-data). The original data format might additionally hold more metadata than currently being specified in the `*_motion.json` file.

encourage users to extract the values of these fields from the actual raw data.

In this example, the `*_motion.json` contains two `TrackingSystems`. One is a [inertial measurement uni (imu)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture#Inertial_systems) system, the other is a optical [motion capture system (omc)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture#Optical_systems). Both have three times as many channels as they have tracked points, because every tracked point is recorded along the x,y and z axis.

Note that the date and time information SHOULD be stored in the Study key file [(`scans.tsv`)](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/03-modality-agnostic-files.html#scans-file). Date time information MUST be expressed as indicated in Units. The [`scans.tsv`](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/03-modality-agnostic-files.html#scans-file) file contains the filename and the acquisition time of a recording, which can be used to synchronize streams. *However, synchronization information between the two systems can also be stored using time stamps in the `*_motion.tsv` if available?.*

## Channels description (`*_channels.tsv`)
```markdown
└─ sub-<label>\
└─ \[ses-<label>]\
└─ motion\
└─ sub-<label>\[\_ses-<label>][\_task-<label>\]_channels.tsv

This file is REQUIRED as it makes it easy to browse or query over larger collections of datasets. The REQUIRED columns are channel `name`, `type`, `tracked_point`, `tracking_system`, `component` and `unit`. Any number of additional columns may be added to provide additional information about the channels. The `*_channels.tsv` file should give additional information about individual recorded channel, some of which my not be found summarised in `TrackingSystems`.

The columns of the channels description table stored in `*_channels.tsv` are:

| component       | REQUIRED              | string        | Component of the representational system described in `*_coordinatesystem.tsv` that the channel contains.                                                                                                           |
| units           | REQUIRED              | string        | Physical unit of the value represented in this channel, for example, vm for virtual meters, radian or degrees for angular quantities. See the BIDS spec for guidelines for Units and Prefixes.                      |

SHOULD be present:

| **Key name** | **Requirement level** | **Data type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                            |
