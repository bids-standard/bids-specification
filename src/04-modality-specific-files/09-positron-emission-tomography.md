# Positron Emission Tomography

Support for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) was developed as a
[BIDS Extension Proposal](../07-extensions.md#bids-extension-proposals).
Please see [Citing BIDS](../01-introduction.md#citing-bids)
on how to appropriately credit this extension when referring to it in the
context of the academic literature.

Several [example PET datasets](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples) have been formatted using this specification
and can be used for practical guidance when curating a new dataset.

Further PET datasets are available from [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org).

## Terminology and conventions

PET-BIDS is fully consistent with the BIDS specification as a whole.
However, BIDS was initially developed in the context of MRI,
so some terminology may be unfamiliar to researchers from each field.
This section adds clarifications to
[Common Principles - Definitions](../02-common-principles.md#definitions)
for the PET context, and introduces the term "time zero" which is currently
specific to PET.

1.  **Session** - In most cases, a new session with respect to PET corresponds
    to a visit to the scanning site, and starts with a new injection.
    In situations where different data types are obtained over several visits
    (for example, FDG PET on one day followed by amyloid PET a couple days after)
    these scans may be grouped into the same session.
    In other datasets, a subject leaving the scanner and returning under the same
    injection may be considered separate sessions.

1.  **Run** - In PET, subjects may have to leave the scanner to use the bathroom.
    While leaving the scanner would interrupt an MR acquisition, in PET this
    disruption is more appropriately considered missing data during a run.

1.  **Time zero** - A reference point in time, to which all timestamps pertaining
    to a recording are relative.
    Time zero will most commonly be the time of injection of a radioisotope, or
    the time at which the first scan of an acquisition is begun.
    If a pharmacological within-scan challenge is performed,
    another time zero may be more convenient.

An overview of a common PET experiment (with blood data) can be seen in Figure 1,
defined on a single time scale relative to a predefined "time zero".

![Figure 1](images/PET_scan_overview.png "Overview of PET recording data")

Figure 1: Overview of a common PET experiment, including blood measurements,
and defined on a common time scale.
Note, "time zero" is often defined as time of injection or scan start,
but if a pharmaceutical challenge is carried out during the scan,
this time point may also be chosen as time zero.
The injected dose, the PET data, and blood data should all be decay-corrected to time zero,
but because the time of injection does not always coincide with scan start,
the PET data may not always be decay-corrected to the time of injection.
If this is not the case, this may be indicated in the reconstruction section
(`ImageDecayCorrected` and `ImageDecayCorrectionTime`).
In the example in the figure, tracer injection coincides with scan start.
In this example, tracer injection coincides with scan start.

## PET recording data

{{ MACROS___make_filename_template(datatypes=["pet"], suffixes=["pet", "events"]) }}

PET data MUST be stored in the `pet` directory.
PET imaging data SHOULD be stored in 4D (or 3D, if only one volume was acquired)
NIfTI files with the `_pet` suffix.
Volumes MUST be stored in chronological order (the order they were acquired in).

The OPTIONAL [`task-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#task) is used to
indicate a task subjects were asked to perform in the scanner.
Those labels MUST be consistent across subjects and sessions.
For task based PET, a corresponding [`task events`](./05-task-events.md) file MUST be provided
(please note that this file is not necessary for resting scans).

The [`trc-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#trc) entity is used to
indicate the tracer used.
This entity is OPTIONAL if only one tracer is used in the study,
but REQUIRED to distinguish between tracers if multiple are used.
The label used is arbitrary and each file requires a separate JSON sidecar
with details of the tracer used (see below).
Examples are `trc-18FFDG` for fludeoxyglucose or `trc-11CPIB` for Pittsburgh compound B.
Other labels are permitted, as long as they are consistent across subjects and sessions
and consist only of the legal label characters.

If more than one run of the same task and acquisition (tracer) are acquired during
the same session, the [`run-<index>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#run) entity MUST be used:
`_run-1`, `_run-2`, `_run-3`, and so on.
If only one run was acquired the `run-<index>` can be omitted.

The OPTIONAL [`rec-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#rec) entity
is used to indicate the reconstruction method used for the image,
with four reserved values:

-   `acdyn`, for reconstructions with attenuation correction of dynamic data;
-   `acstat`, for reconstructions with attenuation correction of static data;
-   `nacdyn`, for reconstructions without attenuation correction of dynamic data;
-   `nacstat`, for reconstructions without attenuation correction of static data.

Further details regarding reconstruction are in the `_pet.json` file.
If multiple reconstructions of the data are made with the same type of reconstruction,
a number MAY be appended to the label,
for example `rec-acdyn1` and `rec-acdyn2`.

### Shared MRI data along with PET

PET and MRI images may be aggregated in the same dataset.
When analyzing MRI and PET data together,
it is essential to specify whether MR images have been corrected for gradient non-linearities,
using the `NonLinearGradientCorrection` metadata field
(see [Sequence Specifics](./01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.md#sequence-specifics)),
which is REQUIRED for all MR data if PET data is also present in the dataset
(see also [PET-MRI correspondence](../99-appendices/13-cross-modality-correspondence.md#pet-mri-correspondence)).
In the case of studies using combined PET/fMRI,
subject-specific tasks may be carried out during the acquisition within the same session.
If the same task is recorded with both modalities,
the same [`task-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#task) entity SHOULD be used.
For further details, see
[Task (including resting state) imaging data](./01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.md#task-including-resting-state-imaging-data).

In addition to the imaging data (`*.nii`) a `_pet.json` sidecar file MUST be provided.
The included metadata are divided into sections described below.

### PET metadata

PET data MUST be described by metadata fields, stored in sidecar JSON files.
These fields are derived from the recommendations in
Knudsen et al. 2020, [doi:10.1177/0271678X20905433](https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678X20905433),

### Recommended patient data

Knudsen et al. 2020
([doi:10.1177/0271678X20905433](https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678X20905433))
recommends recording participant body weight.
If recorded once per participant, these data SHOULD be included in the
[Participants file](../03-modality-agnostic-files.md#participants-file) or as
[Phenotypic and assessment data](../03-modality-agnostic-files.md#phenotypic-and-assessment-data).

For example:

```Text
participant_id body_weight
sub-01 58
sub-02 96
sub-03 72
```

If multiple measurements are made, these data SHOULD be included in the
[Sessions file](../06-longitudinal-and-multi-site-studies.md#sessions-file).

For example:

```Text
session_id body_weight
ses-01 58
ses-02 59
```

## Blood recording data

{{ MACROS___make_filename_template(datatypes=["pet"], suffixes=["blood"]) }}

If collected, blood measurements of radioactivity are be stored in
[Tabular files](../02-common-principles.md#tabular-files) and located in
the `pet/` directory along with the corresponding PET data.

The OPTIONAL `recording` entity is used to distinguish sampling methods.
For example, if an autosampler is used to record continuous blood samples,
and manual measurements are also taken,
then the files may have recording labels `autosampler` and `manual`,
respectively.
If multiple recording methods are used on the same PET acquisition,
the `recording` entity MUST be used to distinguish them.
All blood measurements should be reported according to a single time-scale
in relation to time zero defined by the PET data (Figure 1).
All definitions used below are in accordance with
Innis et al. 2007 ([doi:10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600493](https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600493)).
