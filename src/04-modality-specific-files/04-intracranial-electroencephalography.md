```

The iEEG community uses a variety of formats for storing raw data, and there is
no single standard that all researchers agree on. For BIDS, iEEG data MUST be
stored in one of the following formats:

-   [European Data Format](https://www.edfplus.info/) (`.edf`)

-   [BrainVision Core Data Format](https://www.brainproducts.com/productdetails.php?id=21&tab=5)
    (`.vhdr`, `.eeg`, `.vmrk`) by Brain Products GmbH

-   The format used by the MATLAB toolbox [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab)
    (`.set` and `.fdt` files)

-   [Neurodata Without Borders](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb)
    (`.nwb`)

-   [MEF3](http://msel.mayo.edu/codes.html) (`.mef`)

It is RECOMMENDED to use the European data format, or the BrainVision data
format. It is furthermore discouraged to use the other accepted formats over
these RECOMMENDED formats, particularly because there are conversion scripts
available in most commonly used programming languages to convert data into the
RECOMMENDED formats.

Future versions of BIDS may extend this list of supported file formats. File
formats for future consideration MUST have open access documentation, MUST have
open source implementation for both reading and writing in at least two
programming languages and SHOULD be widely supported in multiple software
packages. Other formats that may be considered in the future should have a clear
added advantage over the existing formats and should have wide adoption in the
BIDS community.

The data format in which the data was originally stored is especially valuable
in case conversion elicits the loss of crucial metadata specific to
manufacturers and specific iEEG systems. We also encourage users to provide
additional meta information extracted from the manufacturer-specific data files
in the sidecar JSON file. Other relevant files MAY be included alongside the
original iEEG data in the [`/sourcedata` directory](../02-common-principles.md#source-vs-raw-vs-derived-data).

Note the RecordingType, which depends on whether the data stream on disk is interrupted or not. Continuous data is by definition 1 segment without interruption. Epoched data consists of multiple segments that all have the same length (e.g., corresponding to trials) and that have gaps in between. Discontinuous data consists of multiple segments of different length, for example due to a pause in the acquisition.

### Terminology: Electrodes vs. Channels

For proper documentation of iEEG recording metadata it is important to
understand the difference between electrode and channel: An iEEG electrode
is placed on or in the brain, whereas a channel is the combination of the analog
differential amplifier and analog-to-digital converter that result in a
potential (voltage) difference that is stored in the iEEG dataset. We employ the
following short definitions:

-   Electrode = A single point of contact between the acquisition system and the
    recording site (e.g., scalp, neural tissue, ...). Multiple electrodes can be
    organized as arrays, grids, leads, strips, probes, shafts, caps (for EEG),
    etc.

-   Channel = A single analog-to-digital converter in the recording system that
    regularly samples the value of a transducer, which results in the signal
    being represented as a time series in the digitized data. This can be
    connected to two electrodes (to measure the potential difference between
    them), a magnetic field or magnetic gradient sensor, temperature sensor,
    accelerometer, etc.

Although the _reference_ and _ground_ electrodes are often referred to as
channels, they are in most common iEEG systems not recorded by themselves.
Therefore they are not represented as channels in the data. The type of
referencing for all channels and optionally the location of the reference
electrode and the location of the ground electrode MAY be specified.

### Sidecar JSON (`*_ieeg.json`)

For consistency between studies and institutions, we encourage users to extract
the values of metadata fields from the actual raw data. Whenever possible,
please avoid using ad hoc wording.

Generic fields MUST be present:

| Field name         | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| TaskName           | REQUIRED. Name of the task (for resting state use the "rest" prefix). No two tasks should have the same name. Task label is derived from this field by removing all non alphanumeric (`[a-zA-Z0-9]`) characters. Note this does not have to be a "behavioral task" that subjects perform, but can reflect some information about the conditions present when the data was acquired (e.g., "rest", "sleep", or "seizure"). |

## Channels description (`*_channels.tsv`)

Template:

```Text

        [sub-<label>[_ses-<label>]_task-<label>[_run-<index>]_channels.tsv]
```

A channel represents one time series recorded with the recording system (for
example, there can be a bipolar channel, recorded from two electrodes or contact
points on the tissue).
Although this information can often be extracted from the iEEG recording,
listing it in a simple `.tsv` document makes it easy to browse or search (e.g.,
searching for recordings with a sampling frequency of >=1000 Hz).
Hence, the channels.tsv is RECOMMENDED.
The two required columns are channel `name` and `type`.
Channels SHOULD appear in the table in the same order they do in the iEEG data
file.
Any number of additional columns may be provided to provide additional
information about the channels.
Note that electrode positions SHOULD NOT be added to this file but to
`*_electrodes.tsv`.

The columns of the Channels description table stored in \*\_channels.tsv are:

| group              | OPTIONAL. Which group of channels (grid/strip/seeg/depth) this channel belongs to. This is relevant because one group has one cable-bundle and noise can be shared. This can be a name or number. Note that any groups specified in `_electrodes.tsv` must match those present here. |
| sampling_frequency | OPTIONAL. Sampling rate of the channel in Hz.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Electrode description (`*_electrodes.tsv`)

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/
    [ses-<label>]/
      ieeg/
         sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_space-<label>]_electrodes.tsv
```

File that gives the location, size and other properties of iEEG electrodes. Note
that coordinates are expected in cartesian coordinates according to the
`iEEGCoordinateSystem` and `iEEGCoordinateSystemUnits` fields in
`*_coordsystem.json`. If an `*_electrodes.tsv` file is specified, a
`*_coordsystem.json` file MUST be specified as well.

The optional space label (`*[_space-<label>]_electrodes.tsv`) can be used to
indicate the way in which electrode positions are interpreted. The space label
needs to be taken from the list in
[Appendix VIII](../99-appendices/08-coordinate-systems.md)

For examples:

-   `_space-MNI152Lin` (electrodes are coregistred and scaled to a specific MNI
    template)

-   `_space-Talairach` (electrodes are coregistred and scaled to Talairach
    space)

When referring to the `*_electrodes.tsv` file in a certain _space_ as defined
above, the `space-<label>` of the accompanying `*_coordsystem.json` MUST
correspond.

For example:

-   `sub-01_space-Talairach_electrodes.tsv`
-   `sub-01_space-Talairach_coordsystem.json`

The order of the required columns in the `*_electrodes.tsv` file MUST be as
listed below.

| iEEGCoordinateSystemDescription     | RECOMMENDED. Freeform text description or link to document describing the iEEG coordinate system system in detail (e.g., "Coordinate system with the origin at anterior commissure (AC), negative y-axis going through the posterior commissure (PC), z-axis going to a mid-hemisperic point which lies superior to the AC-PC line, x-axis going to the right").                                                                            |
| iEEGCoordinateProcessingDescription | RECOMMENDED. Has any post-processing (such as projection) been done on the electrode positions (e.g., "surface_projection", "none").                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| iEEGCoordinateProcessingReference   | RECOMMENDED. A reference to a paper that defines in more detail the method used to localize the electrodes and to post-process the electrode positions. .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Recommended 3D coordinate systems

It is preferred that electrodes are localized in a 3D coordinate system (with
respect to a pre- and/or post-operative anatomical MRI or CT scans or in a
standard space as specified in BIDS [Appendix VIII](../99-appendices/08-coordinate-systems.md)
about preferred names of coordinate systems, such as ACPC).

### Allowed 2D coordinate systems

If electrodes are localized in 2D space (only x and y are specified and z is
n/a), then the positions in this file must correspond to the locations expressed
in pixels on the photo/drawing/rendering of the electrodes on the brain. In this
case, coordinates must be (row,column) pairs, with (0,0) corresponding to the
upper left pixel and (N,0) corresponding to the lower left pixel.

### Multiple coordinate systems

If electrode positions are known in multiple coordinate systems (e.g., MRI, CT
and MNI), these spaces can be distinguished by the optional `[_space-<label>]`
field, see the [`*_electrodes.tsv`-section](#electrode-description-_electrodestsv)
for more information. Note that the `[_space-<label>]` fields must correspond
between `*_electrodes.tsv` and `*_coordsystem.json` if they refer to the same
data.

Example:

```json
{
    "IntendedFor": "/sub-01/ses-01/anat/sub-01_T1w.nii.gz",
    "iEEGCoordinateSystem": "ACPC",
    "iEEGCoordinateUnits": "mm",
    "iEEGCoordinateSystemDescription": "Coordinate system with the origin at anterior commissure (AC), negative y-axis going through the posterior commissure (PC), z-axis going to a mid-hemisperic point which lies superior to the AC-PC line, x-axis going to the right",
    "iEEGCoordinateProcessingDescription": "surface_projection",
    "iEEGCoordinateProcessingReference": "Hermes et al., 2010 JNeuroMeth"
}
```

## Photos of the electrode positions (`*_photo.jpg`)

Template:

```Text
sub-<label>/
    [ses-<label>]/
      ieeg/
         sub-<label>[_ses-<label>][_acq-<label]_photo.json
```

These can include photos of the electrodes on the brain surface, photos of
anatomical features or landmarks (such as sulcal structure), and fiducials. Photos
can also include an X-ray picture, a flatbed scan of a schematic drawing made
during surgery, or screenshots of a brain rendering with electrode positions.
The photos may need to be cropped and/or blurred to conceal identifying features
or entirely omitted prior to sharing, depending on obtained consent.

If there are photos of the electrodes, the acquisition field should be specified
with:

-   `*_photo.jpg` in case of an operative photo

-   `*_acq-xray#_photo.jpg` in case of an x-ray picture

-   `*_acq-drawing#_photo.jpg` in case of a drawing or sketch of electrode
    placements

-   `*_acq-render#_photo.jpg` in case of a rendering

The session label may be used to specify when the photo was taken.

Example of the operative photo of ECoG electrodes (here is an annotated example in
which electrodes and vasculature are marked, taken from Hermes et al.,
JNeuroMeth 2010).

Below is an example of a volume rendering of the cortical surface with a
superimposed subdural electrode implantation. This map is often provided by the
EEG technician and provided to the epileptologists (e.g., see Burneo JG et al.
2014 [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2014.03.020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2014.03.020)).

## Electrical stimulation

In case of electrical stimulation of brain tissue by passing current through the
iEEG electrodes, and the electrical stimulation has an event structure (on-off,
onset, duration), the `_events.tsv` file can contain the electrical stimulation
parameters in addition to other events. Note that these can be intermixed with
other task events. Electrical stimulation parameters can be described in columns
called `electrical_stimulation_<label>`, with labels chosen by the researcher and
optionally defined in more detail in an accompanying `_events.json` file (as
per the main BIDS spec). Functions for complex stimulation patterns can, similar
as when a video is presented, be stored in a folder in the `/stimuli/` folder.
For example: `/stimuli/electrical_stimulation_functions/biphasic.tsv`
