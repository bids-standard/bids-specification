# BIDS Extension Proposals

The BIDS specification can be extended in a backwards compatible way and will
evolve over time. This is accomplished with BIDS Extension Proposals (BEPs),
which are community-driven processes (see [BEP guidelines Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWmEEY-1-WuwBPNy5tDAxVJYQ9Een4hZJM06tQZg8X4/)).

On the [BIDS homepage](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) you can find a list of
extension protocols that are currently being worked on.

All changes that are **not** backwards compatible with the current BIDS
specification will be implemented in BIDS `2.0`. See the corresponding
[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LEgsMiisGDe1Gv-hBp1EcLmoz7AlKj6VYULUgDD3Zdw/)
