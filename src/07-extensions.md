# Contributing to and extending the BIDS specification

This page lists some ways that you can get involved with the BIDS community.

## Contributing to BIDS

There are many ways to get involved with the BIDS community!

### The BIDS Starter Kit

If you're new to the BIDS community and you'd like to learn a bit more, we
recommend checking out the [BIDS Starter Kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/blob/master/README.md).
This has introductory information about the BIDS specification, tools in the
BIDS ecosystem, and how you can get involved.

### The BIDS Contributor guide

If you'd like to get involved more heavily in helping extend the BIDS
specification or develop tools for it, see the [BIDS Contributor Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWmEEY-1-WuwBPNy5tDAxVJYQ9Een4hZJM06tQZg8X4).
It contains more in-depth information for getting involved with the BIDS
community.

## BIDS Extension Proposals

The BIDS specification can be extended in a backwards compatible way and will
evolve over time. These are accomplished with BIDS Extension Proposals (BEPs),
which are community-driven processes.

Below is a table of currently-active BEPs. The "Extension label" column
provides a direct link to the documentation.
