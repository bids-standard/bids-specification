# BIDS Extension Proposals

The BIDS specification can be extended in a backwards compatible way and will
evolve over time. This is accomplished with BIDS Extension Proposals (BEPs),
which are community-driven processes.

On the [BIDS homepage](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) you can find a list of 
extension protocols that are currently being worked on.
