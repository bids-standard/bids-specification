# Contributing to and extending the BIDS specification

This page lists some ways that you can get involved with the BIDS community.

## Contributing to BIDS

There are many ways to get involved with the BIDS community!

### The BIDS Starter Kit

If you're new to the BIDS community and you'd like to learn a bit more, we
recommend checking out the [BIDS Starter Kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/blob/master/README.md).
This has introductory information about the BIDS specification, tools in the
BIDS ecosystem, and how you can get involved.

### The BIDS Contributor guide

If you'd like to get involved more heavily in helping extend the BIDS
specification or develop tools for it, see the [BIDS Contributor Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWmEEY-1-WuwBPNy5tDAxVJYQ9Een4hZJM06tQZg8X4).
It contains more in-depth information for getting involved with the BIDS
community.

## BIDS Extension Proposals

The BIDS specification can be extended in a backwards compatible way and will
evolve over time. These are accomplished with BIDS Extension Proposals (BEPs),
which are community-driven processes.

Below is a table of currently-active BEPs. The "Extension label" column
provides a direct link to the documentation.

When an extension reaches maturity it is merged into the main body of the
specification.  Below is a table of BEPs that have been merged in the main body
of the specification.

All of the extension ideas that are not backwards compatible and thus
will have to wait for BIDS 2.0 are listed
