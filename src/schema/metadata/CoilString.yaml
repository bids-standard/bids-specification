name: CoilString
description: |
  Information describing the selected element of the receiver coil for channel-level data.
  This doesnâ€™t correspond to a tag in the DICOM ontology.
  The vendor-defined identifier for individual channels can go in this field.
  As an example, for Siemens, while coil channels are typically not activated/selected
  individually, data from individual channels may be reconstructed separately.
  The DICOM files containing the combined data will have a `CoilString` entry matching the
  terminology of `ReceiveCoilActiveElements` (for example, `"HEA;HEP"` for the Siemens standard
  32-channel coil when both the anterior and posterior groups are activated),
  while the DICOM files containing channel-level data will have a `CoilString` entry with a
  unique identifier for the channel (for example, `"H1-H32"` for the Siemens standard 32-channel
  coil when both the anterior and posterior groups are activated).
  This is a flexible field that can be used as most appropriate for a given vendor and coil to
  define the reconstructed channel.
