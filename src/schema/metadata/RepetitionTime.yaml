name: RepetitionTime
description: |
  The time in seconds between the beginning of an acquisition of one volume
  and the beginning of acquisition of the volume following it (TR).
  When used in the context of functional acquisitions this parameter best
  corresponds to DICOM Tag 0020,0110: the "time delta between images in a
  dynamic of functional set of images" but may also be found in
  DICOM Tag 0018, 0080: "the period of time in msec between the beginning
  of a pulse sequence and the beginning of the succeeding
  (essentially identical) pulse sequence".
  This definition includes time between scans (when no data has been acquired)
  in case of sparse acquisition schemes.
  This value MUST be consistent with the 'pixdim[4]' field (after accounting
  for units stored in 'xyzt_units' field) in the NIfTI header.
  This field is mutually exclusive with VolumeTiming.
