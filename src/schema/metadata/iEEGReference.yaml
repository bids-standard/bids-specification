description: |
  General description of the reference scheme used and (when applicable) of
  location of the reference electrode in the raw recordings
  (for example, `"left mastoid"`, `"bipolar"`,
  `"T01"` for electrode with name T01,
  `"intracranial electrode on top of a grid, not included with data"`,
  `"upside down electrode"`).
  If different channels have a different reference,
  this field should have a general description and the channel specific
  reference should be defined in the channels.tsv file.
