description: |
  Key:value pairs of any number of additional anatomical landmarks and their
  coordinates in voxel units (where first voxel has index 0,0,0)
  relative to the associated anatomical MRI
  (for example, `{"AC": [127,119,149], "PC": [128,93,141],
  "IH": [131,114,206]}`, or `{"NAS": [127,213,139], "LPA": [52,113,96],
  "RPA": [202,113,91]}`).
  Each array MUST contain three numeric values corresponding to x, y, and z
  axis of the coordinate system in that exact order.
