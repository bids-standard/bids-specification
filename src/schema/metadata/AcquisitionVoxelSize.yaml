name: AcquisitionVoxelSize
description: |
  An array of numbers with a length of 3, in millimeters.
  This parameter denotes the original acquisition voxel size,
  excluding any inter-slice gaps and before any interpolation or resampling
  within reconstruction or image processing.
  Any point spread function effects, for example due to T2-blurring,
  that would decrease the effective resolution are not considered here.
