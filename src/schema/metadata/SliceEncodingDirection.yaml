name: SliceEncodingDirection
description: |
  Possible values: `"i"`, `"j"`, `"k"`, `"i-"`, `"j-"`, `"k-"`
  (the axis of the NIfTI data along which slices were acquired,
  and the direction in which `SliceTiming` is defined with respect to).
  `i`, `j`, `k` identifiers correspond to the first, second and third axis of
  the data in the NIfTI file.
  A `-` sign indicates that the contents of `SliceTiming` are defined in
  reverse order - that is, the first entry corresponds to the slice with the
  largest index, and the final entry corresponds to slice index zero.
  When present, the axis defined by `SliceEncodingDirection` needs to be
  consistent with the â€˜slice_dim' field in the NIfTI header.
  When absent, the entries in `SliceTiming` must be in the order of increasing
  slice index as defined by the NIfTI header.
