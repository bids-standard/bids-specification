name: TotalReadoutTime
description: |
  This is actually the "effective" total readout time,
  defined as the readout duration, specified in seconds,
  that would have generated data with the given level of distortion.
  It is NOT the actual, physical duration of the readout train.
  If `EffectiveEchoSpacing` has been properly computed,
  it is just `EffectiveEchoSpacing * (ReconMatrixPE - 1)`.
