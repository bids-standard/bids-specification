name: CoilCombinationMethod
description: |
  Almost all fMRI studies using phased-array coils use root-sum-of-squares
  (rSOS) combination, but other methods exist.
  The image reconstruction is changed by the coil combination method
  (as for the matrix coil mode above),
  so anything non-standard should be reported.
