name: B0FieldIdentifier
description: |
  The presence of this key states that this particular 3D or 4D image MAY be
  used for fieldmap estimation purposes.
  The `B0FieldIdentifier` MUST be a [BIDS URI][] pointing to a file within one
  participant's tree.
  Using forward-slash separated paths is [DEPRECATED][].
  The value of this field MUST be shared only by the images meant to be used
  as inputs for the estimation of a
  particular instance of the *B<sub>0</sub> field* estimation.
  It is RECOMMENDED to derive this identifier from DICOM Tags, for example,
  DICOM tag 0018, 1030 `Protocol Name`, or DICOM tag 0018, 0024 `Sequence Name`
  when the former is not defined (for example, in GE devices.)
