name: B0FieldIdentifier
description: |
  The presence of this key states that this particular 3D or 4D image MAY be
  used for fieldmap estimation purposes.
  The `B0FieldIdentifier` MUST be a unique string within one participant's tree,
  shared only by the images meant to be used as inputs for the estimation of a
  particular instance of the *B<sub>0</sub> field* estimation.
  It is RECOMMENDED to derive this identifier from DICOM Tags, for example,
  the *Protocol Name* `(0018, 1030)` or the *Sequence Name* `(0018, 0024)`
  when the former is not defined (for example, in GE devices.)
