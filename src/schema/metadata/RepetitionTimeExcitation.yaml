name: RepetitionTimeExcitation
description: |
  The interval, in seconds, between two successive excitations.
  The DICOM tag that best refers to this parameter is
  [(0018, 0080)](http://dicomlookup.com/lookup.asp?sw=Tnumber&q=(0018,0080)).
  This field may be used together with the `RepetitionTimePreparation` for
  certain use cases, such as
  [MP2RAGE](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.002).
  Use `RepetitionTimeExcitation` (in combination with
  `RepetitionTimePreparation` if needed) for anatomy imaging data rather than
  `RepetitionTime` as it is already defined as the amount of time that it takes
  to acquire a single volume in the
  [task imaging data](#task-including-resting-state-imaging-data) section.
