description: |
  The interval, in seconds, that it takes a preparation pulse block to
  re-appear at the beginning of the succeeding (essentially identical) pulse
  sequence block.
  The data type number may apply to files from any MRI modality concerned with
  a single value for this field.
  The data type array provides a value for each volume in a 4D dataset and
  should only be used when the volume timing is critical for interpretation of
  the data, such as in [ASL](#arterial-spin-labeling-perfusion-data).
