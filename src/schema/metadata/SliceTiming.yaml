name: SliceTiming
description: |
  The time at which each slice was acquired within each volume (frame) of the
  acquisition.
  Slice timing is not slice order -- rather, it is a list of times containing
  the time (in seconds) of each slice acquisition in relation to the beginning
  of volume acquisition.
  The list goes through the slices along the slice axis in the slice encoding
  dimension (see below).
  Note that to ensure the proper interpretation of the `SliceTiming` field,
  it is important to check if the OPTIONAL `SliceEncodingDirection` exists.
  In particular, if `SliceEncodingDirection` is negative,
  the entries in `SliceTiming` are defined in reverse order with respect to the
  slice axis, such that the final entry in the `SliceTiming` list is the time
  of acquisition of slice 0. Without this parameter slice time correction will
  not be possible.
