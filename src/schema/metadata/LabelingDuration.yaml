name: LabelingDuration
description: |
  Total duration of the labeling pulse train, in seconds,
  corresponding to the temporal width of the labeling bolus for
  `"PCASL"` or `"CASL"`.
  In case all control-label volumes (or deltam or CBF) have the same
  `LabelingDuration`, a scalar must be specified.
  In case the control-label volumes (or deltam or cbf) have a different
  `LabelingDuration`, an array of numbers must be specified,
  for which any `m0scan` in the timeseries has a `LabelingDuration` of zero.
  In case an array of numbers is provided,
  its length should be equal to the number of volumes specified in
  `*_aslcontext.tsv`.
  Corresponds to DICOM Tag 0018,9258 `ASL Pulse Train Duration`.
