name: PostLabelingDelay
description: |
  This is the postlabeling delay (PLD) time, in seconds, after the end of the
  labeling (for `"CASL"` or `"PCASL"`) or middle of the labeling pulse
  (for `"PASL"`) until the middle of the excitation pulse applied to the
  imaging slab (for 3D acquisition) or first slice (for 2D acquisition).
  Can be a number (for a single-PLD time series) or an array of numbers
  (for multi-PLD and Look-Locker).
  In the latter case, the array of numbers contains the PLD of each volume,
  namely each `control` and `label`, in the acquisition order.
  Any image within the time-series without a PLD, for example an `m0scan`,
  is indicated by a zero.
  Based on DICOM Tags 0018,9079 `Inversion Times` and 0018,0082
  `InversionTime`.
