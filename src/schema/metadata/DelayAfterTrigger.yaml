description: |
  Duration (in seconds) from trigger delivery to scan onset.
  This delay is commonly caused by adjustments and loading times.
  This specification is entirely independent of
  `NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByScanner` or `NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByUser`,
  as the delay precedes the acquisition.
