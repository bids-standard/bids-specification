name: FlipAngle
description: |
  Flip angle (FA) for the acquisition, specified in degrees.
  Corresponds to: DICOM Tag 0018, 1314 `Flip Angle`.
  The data type number may apply to files from any MRI modality concerned with
  a single value for this field, or to the files in a
  [file collection](/99-appendices/10-file-collections.html)
  where the value of this field is iterated using the
  [flip entity](/99-appendices/09-entities.html#flip).
  The data type array provides a value for each volume in a 4D dataset and
  should only be used when the volume timing is critical for interpretation of
  the data, such as in
  [ASL](/04-modality-specific-files/01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.html#\
  arterial-spin-labeling-perfusion-data)
  or variable flip angle fMRI sequences.
