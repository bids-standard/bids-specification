name: PhaseEncodingDirection
description: |
  Possible values: `"i"`, `"j"`, `"k"`, `"i-"`, `"j-"`, `"k-"`.
  The letters `i`, `j`, `k` correspond to the first, second and third axis of
  the data in the NIFTI file.
  The polarity of the phase encoding is assumed to go from zero index to
  maximum index unless `-` sign is present
  (then the order is reversed - starting from the highest index instead of
  zero).
  `PhaseEncodingDirection` is defined as the direction along which phase is was
  modulated which may result in visible distortions.
  Note that this is not the same as the DICOM term
  `InPlanePhaseEncodingDirection` which can have `ROW` or `COL` values.
