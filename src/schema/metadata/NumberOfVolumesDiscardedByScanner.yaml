name: NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByScanner
description: |
  Number of volumes ("dummy scans") discarded by the scanner
  (as opposed to those discarded by the user post hoc)
  before saving the imaging file.
  For example, a sequence that automatically discards the first 4 volumes
  before saving would have this field as 4.
  A sequence that doesn't discard dummy scans would have this set to 0.
  Please note that the onsets recorded in the \_event.tsv file should always
  refer to the beginning of the acquisition of the first volume in the c
  orresponding imaging file - independent of the value of
  `NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByScanner` field.
type: integer
minimum: 0
