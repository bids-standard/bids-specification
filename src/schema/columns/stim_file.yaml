name: stim_file
description: |
  Represents the location of the stimulus file (such as an image, video, or
  audio file) presented at the given onset time.
  There are no restrictions on the file formats of the stimuli files,
  but they should be stored in the /stimuli folder
  (under the root folder of the dataset; with optional subfolders).
  The values under the stim_file column correspond to a path relative to
  "/stimuli".
  For example "images/cat03.jpg" will be translated to "/stimuli/images/cat03.jpg".
