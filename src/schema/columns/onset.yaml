name: onset
description: |
  Onset (in seconds) of the event measured from the beginning of the acquisition
  of the first volume in the corresponding task imaging data file.
  If any acquired scans have been discarded before forming the imaging data file,
  ensure that a time of 0 corresponds to the first image stored.
  In other words negative numbers in "onset" are allowed (see below).

  For example in case there is an in scanner training phase that begins before
  the scanning sequence has started events from this sequence should have
  negative onset time counting down to the beginning of the acquisition of the
  first volume.
