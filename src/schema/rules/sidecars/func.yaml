# Task imaging data

# Required fields
MRIFuncRequired:
    selectors:
    - modality == "MRI"
    - datatype == "func"
    fields:
        RepetitionTime: REQUIRED
        VolumeTiming: REQUIRED
        TaskName:
            level: REQUIRED
            addendum: |
                A RECOMMENDED convention is to name resting state task using labels
                beginning with `rest`.

# Timing Parameters
MRIFuncTimingParameters:
    selectors:
    - modality == "MRI"
    - datatype == "func"

                REQUIRED for sequences that are described with the `VolumeTiming`
                field and that do not have the `SliceTiming` field set to allow for
                accurate calculation of "acquisition time"
        DelayAfterTrigger: RECOMMENDED

            addendum: |
                This is especially important in context of resting state recordings and
                distinguishing between eyes open and eyes closed paradigms.
