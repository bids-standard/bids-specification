# Required fields
MRIFuncRequired:
  selectors:
    - datatype == "func"
    - suffix == "bold"
    - match(extension, "^\.nii(\.gz)?$")
  fields:
    TaskName:
      level: required
      description_addendum: |
        A recommended convention is to name resting state task using labels
        beginning with `rest`.

MRIFuncRepetitionTime:
  selectors:
    - datatype == "func"
    - suffix == "bold"
    - '!("VolumeTiming" in sidecar)'
    - match(extension, "^\.nii(\.gz)?$")
  fields:
    RepetitionTime:
      level: required
      level_addendum: mutually exclusive with `VolumeTiming`

MRIFuncVolumeTiming:
  selectors:
    - datatype == "func"
    - suffix == "bold"
    - '!("RepetitionTime" in sidecar)'
    - match(extension, "^\.nii(\.gz)?$")
  fields:
    VolumeTiming:
      level: required
      level_addendum: mutually exclusive with `RepetitionTime`
      description_addendum: |
        This field is mutually exclusive with `"DelayTime"`.
        If defined, this requires acquisition time (TA) be defined via either
        `"SliceTiming"` or `"FrameAcquisitionDuration"`.

# Timing Parameters
MRIFuncTimingParameters:
  selectors:
    - datatype == "func"
    - suffix == "bold"
    - match(extension, "^\.nii(\.gz)?$")
  fields:
    NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByScanner: optional
    NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByUser: optional
    DelayTime: optional
    FrameAcquisitionDuration:
      level: optional
      level_addendum: |
        required for sequences that are described with the `VolumeTiming`
        field and that do not have the `SliceTiming` field set to allow for
        accurate calculation of "acquisition time"
    DelayAfterTrigger: optional
    AcquisitionDuration:
      level: deprecated
      description_addendum: |
        This field was previously used to indicate volume acquisition duration
        for BOLD data. The `FrameAcquisitionDuration` field should be used instead.

# fMRI task information
MRIFuncTaskInformation:
  selectors:
    - datatype == "func"
    - suffix == "bold"
    - match(extension, "^\.nii(\.gz)?$")
  fields:
    Instructions:
      level: recommended
      description_addendum: |
        This is especially important in context of resting state recordings and
        distinguishing between eyes open and eyes closed paradigms.
    TaskDescription: recommended
    CogAtlasID: recommended
    CogPOID: recommended

# Should now be `part-phase_bold.nii`, but still require units
PhaseSuffixUnits:
  selectors:
    - datatype == "func"
    - suffix == "phase"
    - match(extension, "^\.nii(\.gz)?$")
  fields:
    Units: required
