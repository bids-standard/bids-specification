      description_addendum: |
        A recommended convention is to name resting state task using labels
        beginning with `rest`.

  selectors:
    - modality == "mri"
    - datatype == "func"
    - '!("VolumeTiming" in sidecar)'

  fields:
    RepetitionTime:
      level: required
      level_addendum: mutually exclusive with `VolumeTiming`

# Timing Parameters
MRIFuncTimingParameters:
  selectors:
    - modality == "mri"
    - datatype == "func"
  fields:
    NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByScanner: recommended
    NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByUser: recommended
    DelayTime: recommended
    AcquisitionDuration:
      level: recommended
      level_addendum: |
        required for sequences that are described with the `VolumeTiming`
        field and that do not have the `SliceTiming` field set to allow for
        accurate calculation of "acquisition time"
      issue:
        name: VOLUME_TIMING_MISSING_ACQUISITION_DURATION
        message: |
          The field 'VolumeTiming' requires 'AcquisitionDuration' or 'SliceTiming' to be defined.
    DelayAfterTrigger: recommended

      description_addendum: |
        This is especially important in context of resting state recordings and
        distinguishing between eyes open and eyes closed paradigms.
