  fields:
    TaskName:
      level: required
      description_addendum: |
        Task names for motion datasets usually contain information
        about the specific motion task (for example, "`walking`").

  fields:
    SamplingFrequency:
      level: required
      description_addendum: |
        This field refers to the nominal sampling frequency. For motion data one can use
        "`SamplingFrequencyEffective`" if nominal and effective differ.
        The sampling frequency of data channels that deviate from the main (nominal) sampling
        frequency SHOULD be specified in the "`_tracksys-<label>_channels.tsv`" file.
