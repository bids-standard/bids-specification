  fields:
    EchoTime:
      level: recommended
      level_addendum: |
        required if corresponding fieldmap data is present,
        or the data comes from a multi-echo sequence or Arterial Spin Labeling.
      issue:
        name: ECHO_TIME_NOT_DEFINED
        message: |
          You must define 'EchoTime' for this file. 'EchoTime' is the echo time (TE)
          for the acquisition, specified in seconds. Corresponds to DICOM Tag
          0018, 0081 Echo Time (please note that the DICOM term is in milliseconds
          not seconds). The data type number may apply to files from any MRI modality
          concerned with a single value for this field, or to the files in a file
          collection where the value of this field is iterated using the echo entity.
          The data type array provides a value for each volume in a 4D dataset and
          should only be used when the volume timing is critical for interpretation
          of the data, such as in ASL or variable echo time fMRI sequences.
    InversionTime: recommended
    SliceTiming:
      level: recommended
      level_addendum: |
        required for sparse sequences that do not have the `DelayTime` field set,

        message: |
          You should define 'FlipAngle' for this file, in
          case of a LookLocker acquisition. 'FlipAngle' is the
          flip angle (FA) for the acquisition, specified in degrees.
          Corresponds to: DICOM Tag 0018, 1314 `Flip Angle`. The data
          type number may apply to files from any MRI modality concerned
          with a single value for this field, or to the files in a file
          collection where the value of this field is iterated using the
          flip entity. The data type array provides a value for each volume
          in a 4D dataset and should only be used when the volume timing is

          variable flip angle fMRI sequences.
