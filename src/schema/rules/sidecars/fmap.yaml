        This field is optional, and in case the fieldmaps do not correspond
        to any particular scans, it does not have to be filled.

# Case 1: Phase-difference map and at least one magnitude image
MRIFieldmapPhaseDifferencePhasediff:
  selectors:
    - modality == "mri"
    - datatype == "fmap"
    - suffix == "phasediff"
  fields:
    EchoTime1: required
    EchoTime2: required

# Case 2: Two phase maps and two magnitude images
# NOTE: Need to check for presence of related files.
# For example, magnitude1 needs EchoTime__fmap only if phase1 file exists,
# but EchoTime1 if phasediff exists.
MRIFieldmapTwoPhase:
  selectors:
    - modality == "mri"
    - datatype == "fmap"

# Case 3: Direct field mapping
MRIFieldmapDirectFieldMapping:
  selectors:
    - modality == "mri"
    - datatype == "fmap"
    - suffix == "fieldmap"
  fields:
    Units:
      level: required
      description_addendum: |
        Fieldmaps must be in units of Hertz (`"Hz"`),
        radians per second (`"rad/s"`), or Tesla (`"T"`).

# Case 4: Multiple phase encoded directions ("pepolar")

  selectors:
    - modality == "mri"
    - datatype == "fmap"
    - suffix == "epi"
