MRITimingParameters:

    - modality == "mri"
  fields:
    EchoTime:
      level: recommended
      level_addendum: |
        required if corresponding fieldmap data is present,
        or the data comes from a multi-echo sequence or Arterial Spin Labeling.
      issue:
        name: ECHO_TIME_NOT_DEFINED
        message: |
          You must define 'EchoTime' for this file. 'EchoTime' is the echo time (TE)
          for the acquisition, specified in seconds. Corresponds to DICOM Tag
          0018, 0081 Echo Time (please note that the DICOM term is in milliseconds
          not seconds). The data type number may apply to files from any MRI modality
          concerned with a single value for this field, or to the files in a file
          collection where the value of this field is iterated using the echo entity.
          The data type array provides a value for each volume in a 4D dataset and
          should only be used when the volume timing is critical for interpretation
          of the data, such as in ASL or variable echo time fMRI sequences.
    InversionTime: recommended
    DwellTime: recommended

SliceTimingMRI:
  selectors:
    - modality == "mri"
    - sidecar.MRAcquisitionType == "2D"
  fields:

      level: recommended
      level_addendum: |
        required for sparse sequences that do not have the `DelayTime` field set,
        and Arterial Spin Labeling with `MRAcquisitionType` set on `2D`.
    SliceEncodingDirection: recommended

SliceTimingASL:
  selectors:
    - datatype == "perf"
    - intersects([suffix], ["asl", "m0scan"])
    - sidecar.MRAcquisitionType == "2D"
  fields:
    EchoTime: required
    SliceTiming:
      level: required
      issue:
        code: SLICE_TIMING_NOT_DEFINED_2D_ASL
        message: |
          You should define `SliceTiming` for this file, because `SequenceType` is set
          to a 2D sequence. `SliceTiming` is the time at which each slice was
          acquired within each volume (frame) of the acquisition. Slice timing
          is not slice order -- rather, it is a list of times containing the
          time (in seconds) of each slice acquisition in relation to the beginning
          of volume acquisition. The list goes through the slices along the slice
          axis in the slice encoding dimension (see below). Note that to ensure the
          proper interpretation of the `SliceTiming` field, it is important to check
          if the optional `SliceEncodingDirection` exists. In particular, if
          `SliceEncodingDirection` is negative, the entries in `SliceTiming` are
          defined in reverse order with respect to the slice axis, such that the
          final entry in the `SliceTiming` list is the time of acquisition of slice 0.
          Without this parameter slice time correction will not be possible.

# This is technically for sparse sequences only, but I don't know how to encode that.

  selectors:

  fields:
    FlipAngle:
      level: required
      issue:
        name: LOOK_LOCKER_FLIP_ANGLE_MISSING
        message: |
          You should define 'FlipAngle' for this file, in
          case of a LookLocker acquisition. 'FlipAngle' is the
          flip angle (FA) for the acquisition, specified in degrees.
          Corresponds to: DICOM Tag 0018, 1314 `Flip Angle`. The data
          type number may apply to files from any MRI modality concerned
          with a single value for this field, or to the files in a file
          collection where the value of this field is iterated using the
          flip entity. The data type array provides a value for each volume
          in a 4D dataset and should only be used when the volume timing is
          critical for interpretation of the data, such as in ASL or
          variable flip angle fMRI sequences.
