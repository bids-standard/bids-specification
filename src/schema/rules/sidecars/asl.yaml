        message: |
          You should define `SliceTiming` for this file, because `SequenceType` is sets
          to a 2D sequence. `SliceTiming` is the time at which each slice was
          acquired within each volume (frame) of the acquisition. Slice timing
          is not slice order -- rather, it is a list of times containing the
          time (in seconds) of each slice acquisition in relation to the beginning
          of volume acquisition. The list goes through the slices along the slice
          axis in the slice encoding dimension (see below). Note that to ensure the
          proper interpretation of the `SliceTiming` field, it is important to check
          if the optional `SliceEncodingDirection` exists. In particular, if
          `SliceEncodingDirection` is negative, the entries in `SliceTiming` are
          defined in reverse order with respect to the slice axis, such that the
          final entry in the `SliceTiming` list is the time of acquisition of slice 0.
          Without this parameter slice time correction will not be possible.

        message: |
          You should define `FlipAngle` for this file, in case of a
          LookLocker acquisition. `FlipAngle` is the flip angle (FA)
          for the acquisition, specified in degrees. Corresponds to
          DICOM Tag 0018, 1314 `Flip Angle`. The data type number may
          apply to files from any MRI modality concerned with a single
          value for this field, or to the files in a file collection
          where the value of this field is iterated using the flip entity.
          The data type array provides a value for each volume in a 4D
          dataset and should only be used when the volume timing is critical
          for interpretation of the data, such as in ASL or variable flip
          angle fMRI sequences.
