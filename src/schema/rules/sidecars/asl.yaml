                message: |
                    You should define `SliceTiming` for this file, because `SequenceType` is sets
                    to a 2D sequence. `SliceTiming` is the time at which each slice was
                    acquired within each volume (frame) of the acquisition. Slice timing
                    is not slice order -- rather, it is a list of times containing the
                    time (in seconds) of each slice acquisition in relation to the beginning
                    of volume acquisition. The list goes through the slices along the slice
                    axis in the slice encoding dimension (see below). Note that to ensure the
                    proper interpretation of the `SliceTiming` field, it is important to check
                    if the optional `SliceEncodingDirection` exists. In particular, if
                    `SliceEncodingDirection` is negative, the entries in `SliceTiming` are
                    defined in reverse order with respect to the slice axis, such that the
                    final entry in the `SliceTiming` list is the time of acquisition of slice 0.
                    Without this parameter slice time correction will not be possible.

                message: |
                    You should define `FlipAngle` for this file, in case of a
                    LookLocker acquisition. `FlipAngle` is the flip angle (FA)
                    for the acquisition, specified in degrees. Corresponds to
                    DICOM Tag 0018, 1314 `Flip Angle`. The data type number may
                    apply to files from any MRI modality concerned with a single
                    value for this field, or to the files in a file collection
                    where the value of this field is iterated using the flip entity.
                    The data type array provides a value for each volume in a 4D
                    dataset and should only be used when the volume timing is critical
                    for interpretation of the data, such as in ASL or variable flip
                    angle fMRI sequences.
