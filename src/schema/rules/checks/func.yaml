PhaseSuffixDeprecated:
  issue:
    code: PHASE_SUFFIX_DEPRECATED
    message: |
      DEPRECATED. Phase information associated with magnitude information stored in BOLD contrast.
      This suffix should be replaced by the 'part-phase' entity in conjunction with the 'bold' suffix.
      For backwards compatibility, 'phase' is considered equivalent to 'part-phase_bold'.
      When the 'phase' suffix is not used, each file shares the same name with the exception of the
      'part-<mag|phase>' or 'part-<real|imag>' key/value.

    - datatype == "func"
