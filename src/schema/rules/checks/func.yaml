PhaseSuffixDeprecated:
  issue:
    code: PHASE_SUFFIX_DEPRECATED
    message: |
      DEPRECATED. Phase information associated with magnitude information stored in BOLD contrast.
      This suffix should be replaced by the part-phase in conjunction with the bold suffix.
      For backwards compatibility, _phase is considered equivalent to _part-phase_bold.
      When the _phase suffix is not used, each file shares the same name with the exception of the
      part-<mag|phase> or part-<real|imag> key/value.
    level: warning
  selectors:
    - datatype == "func"
  checks:
    - suffix != "phase"
