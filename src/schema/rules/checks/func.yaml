PhaseSuffixDeprecated:
  issue:
    code: PHASE_SUFFIX_DEPRECATED
    message: |
      DEPRECATED. Phase information associated with magnitude information stored in BOLD contrast.
      This suffix should be replaced by the part-phase in conjunction with the bold suffix.
      For backwards compatibility, _phase is considered equivalent to _part-phase_bold.
      When the _phase suffix is not used, each file shares the same name with the exception of the
      part-<mag|phase> or part-<real|imag> key/value.
    level: warning
  selectors:
    - datatype == "func"
  checks:
    - suffix != "phase"

RepetitionTimeGreaterThan:
  issue:
    code: REPETITION_TIME_GREATER_THAN
    message: |
      'RepetitionTime' is greater than 100 are you sure it's expressed in seconds?

RepetitionTimeMismatch:
  issue:
    code: REPETITION_TIME_MISMATCH
    message: |
      Repetition time did not match between the scan's header and the associated JSON metadata file.
    level: error
  selectors:

BoldNot4d:
  issue:
    code: BOLD_NOT_4D
    message: |
      Bold scans must be 4 dimensional.
    level: error
  selectors:
    - suffix == "bold"

SliceTimingGreaterThanRepetitionTime:
  issue:
    code: SLICETIMING_VALUES_GREATER_THAN_REPETITION_TIME
    message: |
      SliceTiming values contains invalid value as it is greater than RepetitionTime.
      SliceTiming values should be in seconds not milliseconds (common mistake).
    level: error
  selectors:
    - suffix == "bold"
    - type(sidecar.SliceTiming) != "null"
    - type(sidecar.RepetitionTime) != "null"
  checks:
    - max(sidecar.SliceTiming) <= sidecar.RepetitionTime

### The following rules implement the functional imaging acquisition timing rules
### For the sake of informative errors, they are implemented in more rules than

### The selectors/checks are implemented with the least likely case in the selector
