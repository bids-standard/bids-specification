EventsMissing:
  issue:
    code: EVENTS_TSV_MISSING
    message: |
      Task scans should have a corresponding events.tsv file.
      If this is a resting state scan you can ignore this warning or rename the task to include the word "rest".
    level: warning # could be an error with the proper selectors, I think
  selectors:
    - dataset.dataset_description.DatasetType == "raw"
    - '"task" in entities'
    - '!match(entities.task, "rest")'
    - suffix != "events"
  checks:
    - '"events" in associations'
