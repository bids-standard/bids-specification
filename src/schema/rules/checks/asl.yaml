ASLLabelingDurationNiftiLength:
  issue:
    code: LABELING_DURATION_LENGTH_NOT_MATCHING_NIFTI
    message: |
      The number of values for 'LabelingDuration' for this file does not match the 4th dimension
      of the NIfTI header.
      'LabelingDuration' is the total duration of the labeling pulse train, in seconds,
      corresponding to the temporal width of the labeling bolus for `(P)CASL`.
      In case all control-label volumes (or deltam or CBF) have the same `LabelingDuration`, a scalar must be
      specified.
      In case the control-label volumes (or deltam or cbf) have a different `LabelingDuration`,
      an array of numbers must be specified, for which any `m0scan` in the timeseries has a `LabelingDuration` of
      zero.
      In case an array of numbers is provided, its length should be equal to the number of volumes specified in
      `*_aslcontext.tsv`. Corresponds to DICOM Tag 0018,9258 `ASL Pulse Train Duration`.

    code: FLIP_ANGLE_NOT_MATCHING_NIFTI
    message: |
      The number of values for 'FlipAngle' for this file does not match the 4th dimension of the NIfTI header.
      'FlipAngle' is the flip angle (FA) for the acquisition, specified in degrees.
      Corresponds to: DICOM Tag 0018, 1314 `Flip Angle`.
      The data type number may apply to files from any MRI modality concerned with a single value for this field,
      or to the files in a file collection where the value of this field is iterated using the flip entity.
      The data type array provides a value for each volume in a 4D dataset and should only be used when the
      volume timing is critical for interpretation of the data, such as in ASL or variable flip
      angle fMRI sequences.

    message: |
      The number of values for 'PostLabelingDelay' for this file does not match the 4th dimension of the NIfTI
      header.
      'PostLabelingDelay' is the time, in seconds, after the end of the labeling (for (P)CASL) or middle of the
      labeling pulse (for PASL) until the middle of the excitation pulse applied to the imaging slab
      (for 3D acquisition) or first slice (for 2D acquisition).
      Can be a number (for a single-PLD time series) or an array of numbers (for multi-PLD and Look-Locker).
      In the latter case, the array of numbers contains the PLD of each volume
      (that is, each 'control' and 'label')
      in the acquisition order. Any image within the time-series without a PLD (for example, an 'm0scan') is
      indicated by a zero.
