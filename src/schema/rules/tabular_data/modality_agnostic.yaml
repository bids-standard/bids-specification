  columns:
    participant_id:
      level: required
      description_addendum: |
        There MUST be exactly one row for each participant.

Phenotypes:
  selectors:
    - extension == ".tsv"
  initial_columns:
    - participant_id
  columns:
    participant_id:
      level: required
      description_addendum: |
        MUST be the first column in the file.
        Note that data for one participant MAY be represented across multiple rows
        in case of multiple sessions or runs, and
        therefore the entry in the `participant_id` column will be repeated.
    session_id:
      level: optional
      description_addendum: |
        REQUIRED if sessions are defined in the dataset.
        A `session_id` column MUST be added to all tabular files in the phenotype directory
        as soon as multiple sessions are present in the data set
        regardless of whether those sessions are in the
        `phenotype/` data, `sub-<label>/` data, or a combination of the two.
    run:
      level: optional
      description_addendum: |
        REQUIRED if there are multiple runs within any session.
        A chronological `run` number is used when
        a measurement tool or assessment described by a tabular file
        was repeated within a session.
    acq_time__scans:
      level: optional
      description_addendum: |
        If acquisition time is available, the `acq_time` column CAN be used
        to record the time of acquisition of each row in the tabular file.
