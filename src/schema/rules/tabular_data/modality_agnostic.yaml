      description_addendum: |
        Note that data for one participant MAY be represented across multiple rows
        in case of multiple sessions or runs, and
        therefore the entry in the `participant_id` column will be repeated.
    session_id:
      level: optional
      level_addendum: required if sessions are defined in the dataset
      description_addendum: |
        A `session_id` column MUST be added to all tabular files in the phenotype directory
        as soon as multiple sessions are present in the data set
        regardless of whether those sessions are in the
        `phenotype/` data, `sub-<label>/` data, or a combination of the two.
    run_id:
      level: optional
      level_addendum: required if there are multiple runs within any session
      description_addendum: |
        A chronological `run` number is used when
        a measurement tool or assessment described by a tabular file
        was repeated within a session.
