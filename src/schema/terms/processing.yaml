name: Processed (on device)
description: |
  The proc label is analogous to rec for MR and denotes a variant of a file
  that was a result of particular processing performed on the device.
  This is useful for files produced in particular by Elektaâ€™s MaxFilter
  (e.g. sss, tsss, trans, quat, mc, etc.), which some installations impose to
  be run on raw data because of active shielding software corrections before
  the MEG data can actually be exploited.
