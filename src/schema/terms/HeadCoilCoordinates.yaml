name: HeadCoilCoordinates
description: |
  Key:value pairs describing head localization coil labels and their coordinates, interpreted following the HeadCoilCoordinateSystem, e.g., {NAS: [12.7,21.3,13.9], LPA: [5.2,11.3,9.6], RPA: [20.2,11.3,9.1]}. Note that coils are not always placed at locations that have a known anatomical name (e.g. for Elekta, Yokogawa systems); in that case generic labels can be used (e.g. {coil1: [12.2,21.3,12.3], coil2: [6.7,12.3,8.6], coil3: [21.9,11.0,8.1]} ).
