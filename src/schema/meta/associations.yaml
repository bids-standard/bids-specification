# These rules indicate whether an association (defined in meta.context.context.associations)
# applies to a given file. These are hints to allow implementations to avoid unnecessary
# directory and file reads.
#
# Structure:
#
# - "selectors" is a sequence of expressions that apply to a file that may have an association.
#   If matched, a tool MUST attempt to find the associated file.
# - "target" contains a set of path components that may be used to search for the associated file.
#   These override the path components of the original file and MUST match for the associated file.
#   A list of values, such as extensions, indicates multiple possible matches.
# - "inherit" is a boolean indicating whether the associated file may be found at a shallower level
#   of the hierarchy.
