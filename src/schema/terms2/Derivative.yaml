name: Derivative

  Derivatives are outputs of common processing pipelines, capturing data and meta-data sufficient for a researcher to understand and (critically) reuse those outputs in subsequent processing. Standardizing derivatives is motivated by use cases where formalized machine-readable access to processed data enables higher level processing.
