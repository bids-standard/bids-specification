description: |
  RECOMMENDED. Information describing the active/selected elements of the receiver coil. This doesn’t correspond to a tag in the DICOM ontology. The vendor-defined terminology for active coil elements can go in this field. As an example, for Siemens, coil channels are typically not activated/selected individually, but rather in pre-defined selectable groups of individual channels, and the list of the groups of elements that are active/selected in any given scan populates the Coil String entry in Siemens’ private DICOM fields (e.g., HEA;HEP for the Siemens standard 32 ch coil when both the anterior and posterior groups are activated). This is a flexible field that can be used as most appropriate for a given vendor and coil to define the active coil elements. Since individual scans can sometimes not have the intended coil elements selected, it is preferable for this field to be populated directly from the DICOM for each individual scan, so that it can be used as a mechanism for checking that a given scan was collected with the intended coil elements selected
