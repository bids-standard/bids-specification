name: T2-weighted image
description: |
  In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
  The contrast of these images is mainly determined by spatial variations in
  the (true) transverse relaxation time of the imaged specimen.
  In spin-echo sequences this contrast is achieved at relatively long
  repetition and echo times.
  Generally, gradient echo sequences are not the most suitable option for
  achieving T2 weighting, as their contrast natively depends on T2-star rather
  than on T2.
