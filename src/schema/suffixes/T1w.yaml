name: T1-weighted image
description: |
  In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
  The contrast of these images is mainly determined by spatial variations in
  the longitudinal relaxation time of the imaged specimen.
  In spin-echo sequences this contrast is achieved at relatively short
  repetition and echo times.
  To achieve this weighting in gradient-echo images, again, short repetition
  and echo times are selected; however, at relatively large flip angles.
  Another common approach to increase T1 weighting in gradient-echo images is
  to add an inversion preparation block to the beginning of the imaging
  sequence (for example, `TurboFLASH` or `MP-RAGE`).
