name: Equilibrium magnetization (M0) map
description: |
  In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
  A common quantitative MRI (qMRI) fitting variable that represents the amount
  of magnetization at thermal equilibrium.
  M0 maps are RECOMMENDED to use this suffix if generated by qMRI applications
  (for example, variable flip angle T1 mapping).
unit: arbitrary
