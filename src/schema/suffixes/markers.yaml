name: MEG Sensor Coil Positions
description: |
  Another manufacturer-specific detail pertains to the KIT/Yokogawa/Ricoh
  system, which saves the MEG sensor coil positions in a separate file with two
  possible filename extensions  (`.sqd`, `.mrk`).
  For these files, the `markers` suffix MUST be used.
  For example: `sub-01_task-nback_markers.sqd`
