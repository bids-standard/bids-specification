name: Homogeneous (flat) T1-weighted MP2RAGE image
description: |
  In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
  UNIT1 images are REQUIRED to use this suffix regardless of the method used to
  generate them.
  Note that although this image is T1-weighted, regions without MR signal will
  contain white salt-and-pepper noise that most segmentation algorithms will
  fail on.
  Therefore, it is important to dissociate it from from `T1w`.
  Please see [`MP2RAGE` specific notes](/99-appendices/11-qmri.html#unit1-images)
  in the qMRI appendix for further information.
