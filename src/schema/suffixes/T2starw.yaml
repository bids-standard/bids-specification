name: T2star weighted image
description: |
  In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
  The contrast of these images is mainly determined by spatial variations in
  the (observed) transverse relaxation time of the imaged specimen.
  In spin-echo sequences, this effect is negated as the excitation is followed
  by an inversion pulse.
  The contrast of gradient-echo images natively depends on T2-star effects.
  However, for T2-star variation to dominate the image contrast,
  gradient-echo acquisitions are carried out at long repetition and echo times,
  and at small flip angles.
