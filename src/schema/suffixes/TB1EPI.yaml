  This B1<sup>+</sup> mapping method
  ([Jiru and Klose 2006](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.21083)) is based on two
  EPI readouts to acquire spin echo (SE) and stimulated echo (STE) images at
  multiple flip angles in one sequence, used in the calculation of deviations
  from the nominal flip angle.
