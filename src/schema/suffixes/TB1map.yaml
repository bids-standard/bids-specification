name: RF transmit field image
description: |
  In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
  Radio frequency (RF) transmit (B1+) field maps are REQUIRED to use this
  suffix regardless of the method used to generate them.
  TB1map intensity values are RECOMMENDED to be represented as percent
  multiplicative factors such that FlipAngle<sub>effective</sub> =
  B1+<sub>intensity</sub>\*FlipAngle<sub>nominal</sub> .
unit: arbitrary
