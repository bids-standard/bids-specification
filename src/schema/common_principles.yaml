Dataset:
  description: |
    A set of neuroimaging and behavioral data acquired for a purpose of a
    particular study.
    A dataset consists of data acquired from one or more subjects, possibly
    from multiple sessions.
Subject:
  description: |
    A person or animal participating in the study.
    Used interchangeably with term Participant.
Session:
  description: |
    A logical grouping of neuroimaging and behavioral data consistent across
    subjects.
    Session can (but doesn't have to) be synonymous to a visit in a
    longitudinal study.
    In general, subjects will stay in the scanner during one session.
    However, for example, if a subject has to leave the scanner room and then
    be re-positioned on the scanner bed, the set of MRI acquisitions will still
    be considered as a session and match sessions acquired in other subjects.
    Similarly, in situations where different data types are obtained over
    several visits (for example fMRI on one day followed by DWI the day after)
    those can be grouped in one session.
    Defining multiple sessions is appropriate when several identical or similar
    data acquisitions
    are planned and performed on all -or most- subjects, often in the case of
    some intervention between sessions (e.g., training).
Data acquisition:
  description: |
    A continuous uninterrupted block of time during which a brain scanning
    instrument was acquiring data according to particular scanning
    sequence/protocol.
Data type:
  description: |
    A functional group of different types of data.
    BIDS defines eight data types:
    func (task based and resting state functional MRI),
    dwi (diffusion weighted imaging),
    fmap (field inhomogeneity mapping data such as field maps),
    anat (structural imaging such as T1, T2, etc.),
    meg (magnetoencephalography),
    eeg (electroencephalography),
    ieeg (intracranial electroencephalography),
    beh (behavioral).
    Data files are contained in a directory named for the data type.
    In raw datasets, the data type directory is nested inside subject and
    (optionally) session directories.
Task:
  description: |
    A set of structured activities performed by the participant.
    Tasks are usually accompanied by stimuli and responses, and can greatly
    vary in complexity.
    For the purpose of this specification we consider the so-called
    "resting state" a task.
    In the context of brain scanning, a task is always tied to one data
    acquisition.
    Therefore, even if during one acquisition the subject performed multiple
    conceptually different behaviors (with different sets of instructions) they
    will be considered one (combined) task.
Event:
  description: |
    A stimulus or subject response recorded during a task.
    Each event has an onset time and duration.
    Note that not all tasks will have recorded events (e.g., “resting state”).
Run:
  description: |
    An uninterrupted repetition of data acquisition that has the same
    acquisition parameters and task (however events can change from run to run
    due to different subject response or randomized nature of the stimuli).
    Run is a synonym of a data acquisition.
Modality:
  description: |
    The category of brain data recorded by a file.
    For MRI data, different pulse sequences are considered distinct modalities,
    such as T1w, bold or dwi.
    For passive recording techniques, such as EEG, MEG or iEEG, the technique
    is sufficiently uniform to define the modalities eeg, meg and ieeg.
    When applicable, the modality is indicated in the suffix.
    The modality may overlap with, but should not be confused with the data
    type.
index:
  description: |
    A nonnegative integer, possibly prefixed with arbitrary number of 0s for
    consistent indentation, e.g., it is 01 in run-01 following run-<index>
    specification.
label:
  description: |
    An alphanumeric value, possibly prefixed with arbitrary number of 0s for
    consistent indentation, e.g., it is rest in task-rest following
    task-<label> specification.
suffix:
  description: |
    An alphanumeric value, located after the key-value_ pairs
    (thus after the final _), right before the File extension,
    e.g., it is eeg in sub-05_task-matchingpennies_eeg.vhdr.
File extension:
  description: |
    A portion of the the file name after the left-most period (.) preceded by
    any other alphanumeric.
    For example, .gitignore does not have a file extension, but the file
    extension of test.nii.gz is .nii.gz.
    Note that the left-most period is included in the file extension.
