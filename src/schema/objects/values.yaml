    direction. The anatomical landmarks are determined in the individual's
    anatomical scan and no scaling or deformations have been applied to the
    individual's anatomical scan. For more information, see the

    [Nipy Documentation](https://nipy.org/nibabel/coordinate_systems.html). It is
    strongly encouraged to align the subject's T1w to ACPC so that the `ACPC`
    coordinate system can be used. If the subject's T1w in the BIDS dataset
    is not aligned to ACPC, `ScanRAS` should be used.
