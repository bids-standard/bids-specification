ave:
  value: .ave
  display_name: AVE # not sure what ave stands for
  description: |
    File containing data averaged by segments of interest.

    Used by KIT, Yokogawa, and Ricoh MEG systems.
bdf:
  value: .bdf
  display_name: Biosemi Data Format
  description: |
    A [Biosemi](https://www.biosemi.com/) Data Format file.

    Each recording consists of a single `.bdf` file.
    [`bdf+`](https://www.teuniz.net/edfbrowser/bdfplus%20format%20description.html) files are permitted.
    The capital `.BDF` extension MUST NOT be used.
bval:
  value: .bval
  display_name: FSL-Format Gradient Amplitudes
  description: |
    A space-delimited file containing gradient directions (b-vectors) of diffusion measurement.

    The `bval` file contains the *b*-values (in s/mm<sup>2</sup>) corresponding to the
    volumes in the relevant NIfTI file, with 0 designating *b*=0 volumes.
bvec:
  value: .bvec
  display_name: FSL-Format Gradient Directions
  description: |
    A space-delimited file containing gradient directions (b-vectors) of diffusion measurement.

    This file contains 3 rows with *N* space-delimited floating-point numbers,
    corresponding to the *N* volumes in the corresponding NIfTI file.

    The first row contains the *x* elements, the second row contains the *y* elements and
    the third row contains the *z* elements of a unit vector in the direction of the applied
    diffusion gradient, where the *i*-th elements in each row correspond together to
    the *i*-th volume, with `[0,0,0]` for *non-diffusion-weighted* (also called *b*=0 or *low-b*)
    volumes.

    Following the FSL format for the `bvec` specification, the coordinate system of
    the *b* vectors MUST be defined with respect to the coordinate system defined by
    the header of the corresponding `_dwi` NIfTI file and not the scanner's device
    coordinate system (see [Coordinate systems](SPEC_ROOT/appendices/coordinate-systems.md)).
    The most relevant limitation imposed by this choice is that the gradient information cannot
    be directly stored in this format if the scanner generates *b*-vectors in *scanner coordinates*.
