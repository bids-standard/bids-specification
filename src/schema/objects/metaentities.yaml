# This file describes metaentities (generic placeholder designations for one or more entities)
# present in BIDS filenames.
# WARNING: The metaentities are presented here in alphabetical order!
# The appropriate order of entities in filenames is defined in `rules/entities.yaml`,
# rather than this file (`objects/entities.yaml`).
#
# Example of wildcard "any" that could be used to denote all available data types:
#
# any:
#   name: any
#   display_name: any
#   description: |
#     `any` is used as a wildcard in BIDS filenames templates to denote
#     that any acceptable value for the corresponding entity match the
#     template pattern.

#         For example, if employed in replacement of the `data_type` entity:

#         ```Text
#         sub-<label>/
#             [ses-<label>/]
#                 <any>/
#                     sub-<label>_[ses-<label>]_events.<extension>
#         ```

#         this indicates that the filename pattern `sub-<label>_[ses-<label>]_events.<extension>`
#         can be placed under any of the valid `data_type` directories.

matches:
  display_name: matches

    `matches` is used as a placeholder in BIDS filenames templates to denote that several files
    share exactly the same sequence of entities and labels in their basename.

    For example, in the following filename template:

    ```Text
    <matches>_bold.nii.gz
    <matches>_events.tsv
    <matches>_events.json
    ```

    `<matches>` could correspond to `sub-control01_task-nback_run-1`.

source-entities:
  display_name: source entities
  description: |
    `source-entities` is used as a placeholder in BIDS derivatives filenames templates.

    `source-entities` MUST be the entire source filename, with the omission of
    the source suffix and extension.
    One exception to this rule is filename entities that are no longer relevant.
