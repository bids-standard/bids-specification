  description: |
    In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
    For a multi-echo (typically fMRI) sequence, S0 maps index the baseline signal
    before exponential (T2-star) signal decay.
    In other words: the exponential of the intercept for a linear decay model
    across log-transformed echos. For more information, please see, for example,
    [the tedana documentation](https://tedana.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\
    approach.html#monoexponential-decay-model-fit).
    S0 maps are RECOMMENDED to use this suffix if derived from an ME-FMRI dataset.

  name: Longitudinal relaxation time image
  description: |
    In seconds (s).
    T1 maps are REQUIRED to use this suffix regardless of the method used to
    generate them.
    See [this interactive book on T1 mapping](https://qmrlab.org/t1_book/intro)
    for further reading on T1-mapping.
  unit: s
T1rho:
  name: T1 in rotating frame (T1 rho) image
  description: |
    In seconds (s).
    T1-rho maps are REQUIRED to use this suffix regardless of the method used to
    generate them.
  unit: s
T1w:
  name: T1-weighted image
  description: |
    In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
    The contrast of these images is mainly determined by spatial variations in
    the longitudinal relaxation time of the imaged specimen.
    In spin-echo sequences this contrast is achieved at relatively short
    repetition and echo times.
    To achieve this weighting in gradient-echo images, again, short repetition
    and echo times are selected; however, at relatively large flip angles.
    Another common approach to increase T1 weighting in gradient-echo images is
    to add an inversion preparation block to the beginning of the imaging
    sequence (for example, `TurboFLASH` or `MP-RAGE`).
  unit: arbitrary
T2map:
  name: True transverse relaxation time image
  description: |
    In seconds (s).
    T2 maps are REQUIRED to use this suffix regardless of the method used to
    generate them.
  unit: s

  anyOf:
  - unit: arbitrary
  - unit: s
T2starmap:
  name: Observed transverse relaxation time image
  description: |
    In seconds (s).
    T2-star maps are REQUIRED to use this suffix regardless of the method used to
    generate them.
  unit: s
T2starw:
  name: T2star weighted image
  description: |
    In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
    The contrast of these images is mainly determined by spatial variations in
    the (observed) transverse relaxation time of the imaged specimen.
    In spin-echo sequences, this effect is negated as the excitation is followed
    by an inversion pulse.
    The contrast of gradient-echo images natively depends on T2-star effects.
    However, for T2-star variation to dominate the image contrast,
    gradient-echo acquisitions are carried out at long repetition and echo times,
    and at small flip angles.
  unit: arbitrary
T2w:
  name: T2-weighted image
  description: |
    In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
    The contrast of these images is mainly determined by spatial variations in
    the (true) transverse relaxation time of the imaged specimen.
    In spin-echo sequences this contrast is achieved at relatively long
    repetition and echo times.
    Generally, gradient echo sequences are not the most suitable option for
    achieving T2 weighting, as their contrast natively depends on T2-star rather
    than on T2.
  unit: arbitrary

    The double-angle B1<sup>+</sup> method
    ([Insko and Bolinger 1993](https://doi.org/10.1006/jmra.1993.1133)) is based

    collected by two acquisitions at different nominal excitation flip angles.
    Common sequence types for this application include spin echo and echo planar
    imaging.

    from the nominal flip angle.

    This sequence can also be used in conjunction with MP2RAGE T1 mapping to
    iteratively improve B1+ and T1 map estimation
    ([Marques & Gruetter 2013](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069294)).

    suffix regardless of the method used to generate them.
    TB1map intensity values are RECOMMENDED to be represented as percent
    multiplicative factors such that FlipAngle<sub>effective</sub> =
    B1+<sub>intensity</sub>\*FlipAngle<sub>nominal</sub> .

  name: Transmission electron microscopy

UNIT1:
  name: Homogeneous (flat) T1-weighted MP2RAGE image
  description: |
    In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
    UNIT1 images are REQUIRED to use this suffix regardless of the method used to
    generate them.
    Note that although this image is T1-weighted, regions without MR signal will
    contain white salt-and-pepper noise that most segmentation algorithms will
    fail on.
    Therefore, it is important to dissociate it from `T1w`.

    in the qMRI appendix for further information.
