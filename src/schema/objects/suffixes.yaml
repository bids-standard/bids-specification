    See [this interactive book on T1 mapping](https://qmrlab.org/t1_book/intro)
    for further reading on T1-mapping.
  unit: s
T1rho:
  value: T1rho
  display_name: T1 in rotating frame (T1 rho) image
  description: |

  unit: s
T1w:
  value: T1w
  display_name: T1-weighted image
  description: |
    In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
    The contrast of these images is mainly determined by spatial variations in
    the longitudinal relaxation time of the imaged specimen.
    In spin-echo sequences this contrast is achieved at relatively short
    repetition and echo times.
    To achieve this weighting in gradient-echo images, again, short repetition
    and echo times are selected; however, at relatively large flip angles.
    Another common approach to increase T1 weighting in gradient-echo images is
    to add an inversion preparation block to the beginning of the imaging
    sequence (for example, `TurboFLASH` or `MP-RAGE`).
  unit: arbitrary
T2map:
  value: T2map
  display_name: True transverse relaxation time image
  description: |
    In seconds (s).
    T2 maps are REQUIRED to use this suffix regardless of the method used to

    - unit: arbitrary
    - unit: s
T2starmap:
  value: T2starmap
  display_name: Observed transverse relaxation time image
  description: |
    In seconds (s).
    T2-star maps are REQUIRED to use this suffix regardless of the method used to
    generate them.
  unit: s
T2starw:
  value: T2starw
  display_name: T2star weighted image
  description: |
    In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
    The contrast of these images is mainly determined by spatial variations in
    the (observed) transverse relaxation time of the imaged specimen.
    In spin-echo sequences, this effect is negated as the excitation is followed
    by an inversion pulse.
    The contrast of gradient-echo images natively depends on T2-star effects.
    However, for T2-star variation to dominate the image contrast,
    gradient-echo acquisitions are carried out at long repetition and echo times,
    and at small flip angles.
  unit: arbitrary
T2w:
  value: T2w
  display_name: T2-weighted image
  description: |
    In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
    The contrast of these images is mainly determined by spatial variations in
    the (true) transverse relaxation time of the imaged specimen.
    In spin-echo sequences this contrast is achieved at relatively long
    repetition and echo times.
    Generally, gradient echo sequences are not the most suitable option for
    achieving T2 weighting, as their contrast natively depends on T2-star rather
    than on T2.

    This sequence can also be used in conjunction with MP2RAGE T1 mapping to
    iteratively improve B1+ and T1 map estimation
    ([Marques & Gruetter 2013](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069294)).

    multiplicative factors such that FlipAngle<sub>effective</sub> =

UNIT1:
  value: UNIT1
  display_name: Homogeneous (flat) T1-weighted MP2RAGE image
  description: |
    In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
    UNIT1 images are REQUIRED to use this suffix regardless of the method used to
    generate them.
    Note that although this image is T1-weighted, regions without MR signal will
    contain white salt-and-pepper noise that most segmentation algorithms will
    fail on.
    Therefore, it is important to dissociate it from `T1w`.

    Some scanners subtract the `phase1` from the `phase2` map and generate a
    unique `phasediff` file.
    For instance, this is a common output for the built-in fieldmap sequence of
    Siemens scanners.

    Photos of the anatomical landmarks, head localization coils or tissue sample.
physio:
  value: physio
  display_name: Physiological recording
  description: |
    Physiological recordings such as cardiac and respiratory signals.
probseg:
  value: probseg
  display_name: Probabilistic Segmentation
  description: |
    A probabilistic segmentation.

    This suffix may only be used in derivative datasets.
sbref:
  value: sbref
  display_name: Single-band reference image
  description: |
    Single-band reference for one or more multi-band `dwi` images.
scans:
  value: scans
  display_name: Scans file
  description: |
    The purpose of this file is to describe timing and other properties of each imaging acquisition
    sequence (each run file) within one session.
    Each neural recording file SHOULD be described by exactly one row. Some recordings consist of
    multiple parts, that span several files, for example through echo-, part-, or split- entities.
    Such recordings MUST be documented with one row per file.
    Relative paths to files should be used under a compulsory filename header.
    If acquisition time is included it should be listed under the acq_time header.
    Acquisition time refers to when the first data point in each run was acquired.
    Furthermore, if this header is provided, the acquisition times of all files that belong to a
    recording MUST be identical.
    Datetime should be expressed as described in Units.
    Additional fields can include external behavioral measures relevant to the scan.
    For example vigilance questionnaire score administered after a resting state scan.
    All such included additional fields SHOULD be documented in an accompanying _scans.json file
    that describes these fields in detail (see Tabular files).
sessions:
  value: sessions
  display_name: Sessions file
  description: |
    In case of multiple sessions there is an option of adding additional sessions.tsv files
    describing variables changing between sessions.
    In such case one file per participant SHOULD be added.
    These files MUST include a session_id column and describe each session by one and only one row.
    Column names in sessions.tsv files MUST be different from group level participant key column
    names in the participants.tsv file.
stim:
  value: stim
  display_name: Continuous recording
  description: |
    Continuous measures, such as parameters of a film or audio stimulus.
uCT:
  value: uCT
  display_name: Micro-CT
