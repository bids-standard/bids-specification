  description: |
    Version history of the dataset (describing changes, updates and corrections) MAY be provided in
    the form of a `CHANGES` text file.
    This file MUST follow the
    [CPAN Changelog convention](https://metacpan.org/pod/release/HAARG/CPAN-Changes-0.400002/lib/\
    CPAN/Changes/Spec.pod).
    The `CHANGES` file MUST be either in ASCII or UTF-8 encoding.
LICENSE:
  display_name: License
  file_type: regular
  description: |
    A `LICENSE` file MAY be provided in addition to the short specification of the
    used license in the `dataset_description.json` `"License"` field.
    The `"License"` field and `LICENSE` file MUST correspond.
    The `LICENSE` file MUST be either in ASCII or UTF-8 encoding.
README:
  display_name: README
  file_type: regular
  description: |
    A REQUIRED text file, `README`, SHOULD describe the dataset in more detail.
    The `README` file MUST be either in ASCII or UTF-8 encoding and MAY have one of the extensions:
    `.md` ([Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)),
    `.rst` ([reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html)),
    or `.txt`.
    A BIDS dataset MUST NOT contain more than one `README` file (with or without extension)
    at its root directory.
    BIDS does not make any recommendations with regards to the
    [Markdown flavor](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#lightweight-markup-languages)
    and does not validate the syntax of Markdown and reStructuredText.
    The `README` file SHOULD be structured such that its contents can be easily understood
    even if the used format is not rendered.
    A guideline for creating a good `README` file can be found in the
    [bids-starter-kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/blob/master/templates/README).
dataset_description:
  display_name: Dataset Description
  file_type: regular
  description: |
    The file `dataset_description.json` is a JSON file describing the dataset.
genetic_info:
  display_name: Genetic Information
  file_type: regular
  description: |
    The `genetic_info.json` file describes the genetic information available in the
    `participants.tsv` file and/or the genetic database described in
    `dataset_description.json`.
    Datasets containing the `Genetics` field in `dataset_description.json` or the
    `genetic_id` column in `participants.tsv` MUST include this file.
participants:
  display_name: Participant Information
  file_type: regular
  description: |
    The purpose of this RECOMMENDED file is to describe properties of participants
    such as age, sex, handedness.
    If this file exists, it MUST contain the column `participant_id`,
    which MUST consist of `sub-<label>` values identifying one row for each participant,
    followed by a list of optional columns describing participants.
    Each participant MUST be described by one and only one row.

    Commonly used *optional* columns in `participant.tsv` files are `age`, `sex`,
    and `handedness`. We RECOMMEND to make use of these columns, and
    in case that you do use them, we RECOMMEND to use the following values
    for them:

    -   `age`: numeric value in years (float or integer value)

    -   `sex`: string value indicating phenotypical sex, one of "male", "female",
        "other"

        -   for "male", use one of these values: `male`, `m`, `M`, `MALE`, `Male`

        -   for "female", use one of these values: `female`, `f`, `F`, `FEMALE`,
            `Female`

        -   for "other", use one of these values: `other`, `o`, `O`, `OTHER`,
            `Other`

    -   `handedness`: string value indicating one of "left", "right",
        "ambidextrous"

        -   for "left", use one of these values: `left`, `l`, `L`, `LEFT`, `Left`

        -   for "right", use one of these values: `right`, `r`, `R`, `RIGHT`,
            `Right`

        -   for "ambidextrous", use one of these values: `ambidextrous`, `a`, `A`,
            `AMBIDEXTROUS`, `Ambidextrous`

    Throughout BIDS you can indicate missing values with `n/a` (for "not
    available").

samples:
  display_name: Sample Information
  file_type: regular
  description: |
    The purpose of this file is to describe properties of samples, indicated by the `sample` entity.
    This file is REQUIRED if `sample-<label>` is present in any file name within the dataset.
    If this file exists, it MUST contain the three following columns:

    -   `sample_id`: MUST consist of `sample-<label>` values identifying one row
        for each sample

    -   `participant_id`: MUST consist of `sub-<label>`

    -   `sample_type`: MUST consist of sample type values, either `cell line`, `in vitro differentiated cells`,
        `primary cell`, `cell-free sample`, `cloning host`, `tissue`, `whole organisms`, `organoid` or
        `technical sample` from [ENCODE Biosample Type](https://www.encodeproject.org/profiles/biosample_type)

    Other optional columns MAY be used to describe the samples.
    Each sample MUST be described by one and only one row.

    Commonly used *optional* columns in `samples.tsv` files are `pathology` and
    `derived_from`. We RECOMMEND to make use of these columns, and in case that
    you do use them, we RECOMMEND to use the following values for them:

    -   `pathology`: string value describing the pathology of the sample or type of control.
        When different from `healthy`, pathology SHOULD be specified in `samples.tsv`.
        The pathology MAY instead be specified in
        [Sessions files](SPEC_ROOT/modality-agnostic-files.md#sessions-file) in case it changes over time.

    -   `derived_from`: `sample-<label>` key/value pair from which a sample is derived from,
        for example a slice of tissue (`sample-02`) derived from a block of tissue (`sample-01`)
