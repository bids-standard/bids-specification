    Acquisition time refers to when the first data point in each run was acquired.
    Furthermore, if this header is provided, the acquisition times of all files that
    belong to a recording MUST be identical.

    Datetime should be expressed as described in [Units](/02-common-principles.html#units).

    For anonymization purposes all dates within one subject should be shifted by a randomly
    chosen (but consistent across all recordings) number of days.
    This way relative timing would be preserved, but chances of identifying a person based
    on the date and time of their scan would be decreased.
    Dates that are shifted for anonymization purposes SHOULD be set to the year 1925 or earlier
    to clearly distinguish them from unmodified data.
    Note that some data formats do not support arbitrary recording dates.
    For example, the [EDF](https://www.edfplus.info/)
    data format can only contain recording dates after 1985.
    Shifting dates is RECOMMENDED, but not required.

  description: |
    Onset (in seconds) of the event, measured from the beginning of the acquisition
    of the first data point stored in the corresponding task data file.

    stored data point.

    the scanning sequence has started events from this sequence should have
    negative onset time counting down to the beginning of the acquisition of the
    first volume.

    If any data points have been discarded before forming the data file

    acquired data point.
