description: |
  If several scans with the same acquisition parameters are acquired in the same session,
  they MUST be indexed with the [`run-<index>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#run) entity:
  `_run-1`, `_run-2`, `_run-3`, and so on (only nonnegative integers are allowed as
  run labels).

  If different entities apply,
  such as a different session indicated by [`ses-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#ses),
  or different acquisition parameters indicated by
  [`acq-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#acq),
  then `run` is not needed to distinguish the scans and MAY be omitted.
