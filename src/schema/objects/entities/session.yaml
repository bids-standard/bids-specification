description: |
  A logical grouping of neuroimaging and behavioral data consistent across
  subjects.
  Session can (but doesn't have to) be synonymous to a visit in a
  longitudinal study.
  In general, subjects will stay in the scanner during one session.
  However, for example, if a subject has to leave the scanner room and then
  be re-positioned on the scanner bed, the set of MRI acquisitions will still
  be considered as a session and match sessions acquired in other subjects.
  Similarly, in situations where different data types are obtained over
  several visits (for example fMRI on one day followed by DWI the day after)
  those can be grouped in one session.
  Defining multiple sessions is appropriate when several identical or similar
  data acquisitions are planned and performed on all -or most- subjects,
  often in the case of some intervention between sessions
  (for example, training).
