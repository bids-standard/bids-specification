name: Space
entity: space
description: |
  The space entity can be used to indicate
  the way in which electrode positions are interpreted
  (for EEG/MEG/iEEG data) or
  the spatial reference to which a file has been aligned (for MRI data).
  The space `<label>` MUST be taken from one of the modality specific lists in
  [Appendix VIII](../99-appendices/08-coordinate-systems.md).
  For example for iEEG data, the restricted keywords listed under
  [iEEG Specific Coordinate Systems](../99-appendices/08-coordinate-systems.md#ieeg-specific-coordinate-systems)
  are acceptable for `<label>`.

  For EEG/MEG/iEEG data, this entity can be applied to raw data, but
  for other data types, it is restricted to derivative data.
