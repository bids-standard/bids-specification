name: Participant Information
description: |
  The purpose of this RECOMMENDED file is to describe properties of participants
  such as age, sex, handedness.
  If this file exists, it MUST contain the column `participant_id`,
  which MUST consist of `sub-<label>` values identifying one row for each participant,
  followed by a list of optional columns describing participants.
  Each participant MUST be described by one and only one row.

  Commonly used *optional* columns in `participant.tsv` files are `age`, `sex`,
  and `handedness`. We RECOMMEND to make use of these columns, and
  in case that you do use them, we RECOMMEND to use the following values
  for them:

  -   `age`: numeric value in years (float or integer value)

  -   `sex`: string value indicating phenotypical sex, one of "male", "female",
      "other"

      -   for "male", use one of these values: `male`, `m`, `M`, `MALE`, `Male`

      -   for "female", use one of these values: `female`, `f`, `F`, `FEMALE`,
          `Female`

      -   for "other", use one of these values: `other`, `o`, `O`, `OTHER`,
          `Other`

  -   `handedness`: string value indicating one of "left", "right",
      "ambidextrous"

      -   for "left", use one of these values: `left`, `l`, `L`, `LEFT`, `Left`

      -   for "right", use one of these values: `right`, `r`, `R`, `RIGHT`,
          `Right`

      -   for "ambidextrous", use one of these values: `ambidextrous`, `a`, `A`,
          `AMBIDEXTROUS`, `Ambidextrous`

  Throughout BIDS you can indicate missing values with `n/a` (for "not
  available").
