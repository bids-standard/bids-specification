name: Proton density (PD) weighted image
description: |
  In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
  The contrast of these images is mainly determined by spatial variations in
  the spin density (1H) of the imaged specimen.
  In spin-echo sequences this contrast is achieved at short repetition and long
  echo times.
  In a gradient-echo acquisition, PD weighting dominates the contrast at long
  repetition and short echo times, and at small flip angles.
unit: arbitrary
