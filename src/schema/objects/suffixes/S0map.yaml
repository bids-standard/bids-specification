name: Observed signal amplitude (S0) image
description: |
  In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
  For a multi-echo (typically fMRI) sequence, S0 maps index the baseline signal
  before exponential (T2-star) signal decay.
  In other words: the exponential of the intercept for a linear decay model
  across log-transformed echos. For more information, please see, for example,
  [the tedana documentation](https://tedana.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\
  approach.html#monoexponential-decay-model-fit).
  S0 maps are RECOMMENDED to use this suffix if derived from an ME-FMRI dataset.
