  The double-angle B1<sup>+</sup> method
  ([Insko and Bolinger 1993](https://doi.org/10.1006/jmra.1993.1133)) is based
  on the calculation of the actual angles from signal ratios,
  collected by two acquisitions at different nominal excitation flip angles.
  Common sequence types for this application include spin echo and echo planar
  imaging.
