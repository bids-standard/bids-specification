name: Magnetization transfer saturation
description: |
  This method is to calculate a semi-quantitative magnetization transfer
  saturation index map.
  The MTS method involves three sets of anatomical images that differ in terms
  of application of a magnetization transfer RF pulse (MTon or MToff) and flip
  angle ([Helms et al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.21732)).
