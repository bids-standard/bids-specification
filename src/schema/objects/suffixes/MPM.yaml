name: Multi-parametric Mapping
description: |
  The MPM approaches (a.k.a hMRI) involves the acquisition of highly-similar
  anatomical images that differ in terms of application of a magnetization
  transfer RF pulse (MTon or MToff), flip angle and (optionally) echo time and
  magnitue/phase parts
  ([Weiskopf et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2013.00095)).
  See [here](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/iv2TOQwGy4FGDDZ) for
  suggested MPM acquisition protocols.
