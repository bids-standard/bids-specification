name: RF receive sensitivity map
description: |
  In arbitrary units (arbitrary).
  Radio frequency (RF) receive (B1-) sensitivity maps are REQUIRED to use this
  suffix regardless of the method used to generate them.
  RB1map intensity values are RECOMMENDED to be represented as percent
  multiplicative factors such that Amplitude<sub>effective</sub> =
  B1-<sub>intensity</sub>\*Amplitude<sub>ideal</sub>.
unit: arbitrary
