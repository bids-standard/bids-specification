  Saturation-prepared with 2 rapid gradient echoes (SA2RAGE) uses a ratio of
  two saturation recovery images with different time delays,
  and a simulated look-up table to estimate B1+
  ([Eggenschwiler et al. 2011](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.23145)).
  This sequence can also be used in conjunction with MP2RAGE T1 mapping to
  iteratively improve B1+ and T1 map estimation
  ([Marques & Gruetter 2013](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069294)).
