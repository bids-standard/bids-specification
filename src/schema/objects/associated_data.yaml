  description: |
    A directory in which to store any code
    (for example the one used to generate the derivatives from the raw data).
    See the [code section](SPEC_ROOT/03-modality-agnostic-files.md#code)
    for more information.
derivatives:
  display_name: |
    Derivative data.
    See the [source, raw, derived data section](SPEC_ROOT/02-common-principles.md#source-vs-raw-vs-derived-data)
    for more information.

    Derivative data
sourcedata:
  display_name: Source data
  description: |
    Data before harmonization, reconstruction, and/or file format conversion
    (for example, E-Prime event logs or DICOM files).
    See the [source, raw, derived data section](SPEC_ROOT/02-common-principles.md#source-vs-raw-vs-derived-data)
    for more information.
stimuli:
  display_name: Stimulus files
  description: |
    The stimulus files can be added in a `/stimuli` directory
    (under the root directory of the dataset; with optional subdirectories)
    AND using a `stim_file` column in `*_events.tsv` mentioning
    which stimulus file was used for a given event.
    There are no restrictions on the file formats of the stimuli files,
    but they should be stored in the `/stimuli` directory.
    See the [stimuli section](SPEC_ROOT/04-modality-specific-files/05-task-events.md#stimuli)
    for more information.
