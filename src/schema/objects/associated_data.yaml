    Data before harmonization, reconstruction, and/or file format conversion
    (for example, E-Prime event logs or DICOM files).
stimuli:
  name: Stimulus files
  description: |
    The stimulus files can be added in a `/stimuli` directory
    (under the root directory of the dataset; with optional subdirectories)
    AND using a stim_file column in *_events.tsv mentioning which stimulus file was
    used for a given event.

    There are no restrictions on the file formats of the stimuli files, but they should be
    stored in the `/stimuli` directory.
