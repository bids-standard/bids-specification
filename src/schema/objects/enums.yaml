Pixels:
  value: Pixels
  display_name: Pixels
  description: |
    If electrodes are localized in 2D space (only x and y are
    specified and z is n/a), then the positions in this file must correspond to
    the locations expressed in pixels on the photo/drawing/rendering of the
    electrodes on the brain. In this case, coordinates must be (row,column)
    pairs, with (0,0) corresponding to the upper left pixel and (N,0)

  description: |
    The origin of the coordinate system is at the Anterior Commissure
    and the negative y-axis is passing through the Posterior Commissure. The
    positive z-axis is passing through a mid-hemispheric point in the superior
    direction. The anatomical landmarks are determined in the individual's
    anatomical scan and no scaling or deformations have been applied to the
    individual's anatomical scan. For more information, see the
    [ACPC site](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/acpc/) on the FieldTrip
    toolbox wiki.
ScanRAS:

    [Nipy Documentation](https://nipy.org/nibabel/coordinate_systems.html). It is
    strongly encouraged to align the subject's T1w to ACPC so that the `ACPC`
    coordinate system can be used. If the subject's T1w in the BIDS dataset
    is not aligned to ACPC, `ScanRAS` should be used.
