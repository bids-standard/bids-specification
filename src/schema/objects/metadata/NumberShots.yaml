name: NumberShots
description: |
  The number of RF excitations needed to reconstruct a slice or volume
  (may be referred to as partition).
  Please mind that this is not the same as Echo Train Length which denotes the
  number of k-space lines collected after excitation in a multi-echo readout.
  The data type array is applicable for specifying this parameter before and
  after the k-space center is sampled.
  Please see
  [`NumberShots` metadata field]\
  (/99-appendices/11-qmri.html#numbershots-metadata-field)
  in the qMRI appendix for corresponding calculations.
