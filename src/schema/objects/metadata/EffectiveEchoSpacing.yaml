description: |
  The "effective" sampling interval, specified in seconds,
  between lines in the phase-encoding direction,
  defined based on the size of the reconstructed image in the phase direction.
  It is frequently, but incorrectly, referred to as "dwell time"
  (see `DwellTime` parameter below for actual dwell time).
  It is required for unwarping distortions using field maps.
  Note that beyond just in-plane acceleration,
  a variety of other manipulations to the phase encoding need to be accounted
  for properly, including partial fourier, phase oversampling,
  phase resolution, phase field-of-view and interpolation.
