name: TaskName
description: |
  Name of the task.
  No two tasks should have the same name.
  The task label included in the file name is derived from this TaskName field
  by removing all non-alphanumeric (`[a-zA-Z0-9]`) characters.
  For example `TaskName` `"faces n-back"` will correspond to task label
  `facesnback`.
  A RECOMMENDED convention is to name resting state task using labels beginning
  with `rest`.
