    The "effective" sampling interval, specified in seconds,

    (see the `"DwellTime"` parameter for actual dwell time).
    It is required for unwarping distortions using field maps.
    Note that beyond just in-plane acceleration,
    a variety of other manipulations to the phase encoding need to be accounted
    for properly, including partial fourier, phase oversampling,
    phase resolution, phase field-of-view and interpolation.

  description: |

    and the direction in which `"SliceTiming"` is defined with respect to.
    `i`, `j`, `k` identifiers correspond to the first, second and third axis of
    the data in the NIfTI file.
    A `-` sign indicates that the contents of `"SliceTiming"` are defined in
    reverse order - that is, the first entry corresponds to the slice with the
    largest index, and the final entry corresponds to slice index zero.
    When present, the axis defined by `"SliceEncodingDirection"` needs to be
    consistent with the `slice_dim` field in the NIfTI header.
    When absent, the entries in `"SliceTiming"` must be in the order of increasing
    slice index as defined by the NIfTI header.

SliceTiming:
  name: SliceTiming
  description: |
    The time at which each slice was acquired within each volume (frame) of the
    acquisition.
    Slice timing is not slice order -- rather, it is a list of times containing
    the time (in seconds) of each slice acquisition in relation to the beginning
    of volume acquisition.
    The list goes through the slices along the slice axis in the slice encoding
    dimension (see below).
    Note that to ensure the proper interpretation of the `"SliceTiming"` field,
    it is important to check if the OPTIONAL `SliceEncodingDirection` exists.
    In particular, if `"SliceEncodingDirection"` is negative,
    the entries in `"SliceTiming"` are defined in reverse order with respect to the
    slice axis, such that the final entry in the `"SliceTiming"` list is the time
    of acquisition of slice 0. Without this parameter slice time correction will
    not be possible.
