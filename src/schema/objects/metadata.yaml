    For Siemens, this corresponds to DICOM field 0019, 1018 (in ns).
    This value is necessary for the optional readout distortion correction of
    anatomicals in the HCP Pipelines.
    It also usefully provides a handle on the readout bandwidth,
    which isn't captured in the other metadata tags.
    Not to be confused with `"EffectiveEchoSpacing"`, and the frequent mislabeling
    of echo spacing (which is spacing in the phase encoding direction) as
    "dwell time" (which is spacing in the readout direction).

  description: |
    The time at which each slice was acquired within each volume (frame) of the

    of volume acquisition.
    The list goes through the slices along the slice axis in the slice encoding
    dimension (see below).
    Note that to ensure the proper interpretation of the `"SliceTiming"` field,
    it is important to check if the OPTIONAL `SliceEncodingDirection` exists.
    In particular, if `"SliceEncodingDirection"` is negative,
    the entries in `"SliceTiming"` are defined in reverse order with respect to the
    slice axis, such that the final entry in the `"SliceTiming"` list is the time
    of acquisition of slice 0. Without this parameter slice time correction will

    A list of files with the paths specified using

    these files were directly used in the creation of this derivative data file.
    For example, if a derivative A is used in the creation of another
    derivative B, which is in turn used to generate C in a chain of A->B->C,
    C should only list B in `"Sources"`, and B should only list A in `"Sources"`.
    However, in case both X and Y are directly used in the creation of Z,
    then Z should list X and Y in `"Sources"`,
