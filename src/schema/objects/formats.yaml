# This file defines valid patterns for different formats
# Entity patterns
label:
  description: |
    Freeform labels without special characters.
  pattern: ^[0-9a-zA-Z]+$
index:
  description: |
    Non-negative, non-zero integers, optionally prefixed with leading zeros for sortability.
    An index may not be all zeros.
  pattern: ^[0-9]*[1-9]+[0-9]*$
# Metadata types
string:
  description: |
    The basic string type (not a specific format).
    This should allow any free-form string.
  pattern: ^.*$
integer:
  description: |
    An integer which may be positive or negative.
  pattern: ^[+-]?\d+$
number:
  description: |
    A number which may be an integer or float, positive or negative.
  pattern: ^[+-]?([0-9]+([.][0-9]*)?|[.][0-9]+)$
boolean:
  description: |
    A boolean.
    Must be either "true" or "false".
  pattern: ^(true|false)$
# String formats
date:
  description: |
    A date in the form `"YYYY-MM-DD[Z]"`,
    where [Z] is an optional, valid timezone code.
  pattern: ^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}?([A-Z]{3,4})$
datetime:
  description: |
    A datetime in the form `"YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[.000000][Z]"`,
    where [.000000] is an optional subsecond resolution between 1 and 6 decimal points,
    and [Z] is an optional, valid timezone code.
  pattern: ^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}T[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}?(\.[0-9]{1,6})?([A-Z]{3,4})$
time:
  description: |
    A time in the form `"hh:mm:ss"`.
  pattern: ^(?:2[0-3]|[01][0-9]):[0-5][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]$
unit:
  description: |
    A unit.
    SI units in CMIXF formatting are RECOMMENDED
    (see [Units](/02-common-principles.html#units)).

    Currently this matches any string.

    TODO: Somehow reference the actual unit options in the Units appendix.
  pattern: ^.*$
stimuli_relative:
  description: |
    A path to a stimulus file, relative to a `/stimuli` folder somewhere.

    The validation for this format is minimal.
    It simply ensures that the value is a string with any characters that may appear in a valid path,
    without starting with "/" (an absolute path) or "stimuli/"
    (a relative path starting with the stimuli folder, rather than relative to that folder).
  pattern: ^(?!/)(?!stimuli/)[0-9a-zA-Z/\_\-\.]+$
dataset_relative:
  description: |
    A path to a file, relative to the dataset folder.

    The validation for this format is minimal.
    It simply ensures that the value is a string with any characters that may appear in a valid path,
    without starting with "/" (an absolute path).
  pattern: ^(?!/)[0-9a-zA-Z/\_\-\.]+$
participant_relative:
  description: |
    A path to a file, relative to the participant's folder in the dataset.

    The validation for this format is minimal.
    It simply ensures that the value is a string with any characters that may appear in a valid path,
    without starting with "/" (an absolute path) or "sub/"
    (a relative path starting with the participant folder, rather than relative to that folder).
  pattern: ^(?!/)(?!sub-)[0-9a-zA-Z/\_\-\.]+$
rrid:
  description: |
    A [research resource identifier](https://scicrunch.org/resources).
  pattern: ^RRID:.+_.+$
uri:
  description: |
    A uniform resource indicator.
  pattern: ^(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?$
bids_uri:
  description: |
    A BIDS uniform resource indicator.

    The validation for this format is minimal.
    It simply ensures that the value is a string with any characters that may appear in a valid URI,
    starting with "bids:".
  pattern: ^bids:[0-9a-zA-Z/#:\?\_\-\.]+$
