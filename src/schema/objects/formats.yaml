# This file defines valid patterns for different formats
# Entity patterns
index:
  name: Index
  description: |
    Non-negative, non-zero integers, optionally prefixed with leading zeros for sortability.
    An index may not be all zeros.
  pattern: '[0-9]*[1-9]+[0-9]*'
label:
  name: Label
  description: |
    Freeform labels without special characters.
  pattern: '[0-9a-zA-Z]+'
# Metadata types
boolean:
  name: Boolean
  description: |
    A boolean.
    Must be either "true" or "false".
  pattern: '(true|false)'
integer:
  name: Integer
  description: |
    An integer which may be positive or negative.
  pattern: '[+-]?\d+'
number:
  name: Number
  description: |
    A number which may be an integer or float, positive or negative.
  pattern: '[+-]?([0-9]+([.][0-9]*)?|[.][0-9]+)([eE][+-]?[0-9]+)?'
string:
  name: String
  description: |
    The basic string type (not a specific format).
    This should allow any free-form string.
  pattern: '.*'
# String formats
bids_uri:
  name: BIDS uniform resource indicator
  description: |
    A BIDS uniform resource indicator.

    The validation for this format is minimal.
    It simply ensures that the value is a string with any characters that may appear in a valid URI,
    starting with "bids:".
  pattern: 'bids:[0-9a-zA-Z/#:\?\_\-\.]+'
dataset_relative:
  name: Path relative to the BIDS dataset directory
  description: |
    A path to a file, relative to the dataset directory.

    The validation for this format is minimal.
    It simply ensures that the value is a string with any characters that may appear in a valid path,
    without starting with "/" (an absolute path).
  pattern: '(?!/)[0-9a-zA-Z/\_\-\.]+'
date:
  name: Date
  description: |
    A date in the form `"YYYY-MM-DD[Z]"`,
    where [Z] is an optional, valid timezone code.
  pattern: '[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}([A-Z]{2,4})?'
datetime:
  name: Datetime
  description: |
    A datetime in the form `"YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[.000000][Z]"`,
    where [.000000] is an optional subsecond resolution between 1 and 6 decimal points,
    and [Z] is an optional, valid timezone code.
  pattern: '[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}T(?:2[0-3]|[01][0-9]):[0-5][0-9]:[0-5][0-9](\.[0-9]{1,6})?([A-Z]{2,4})?'
file_relative:
  name: Path relative to the parent file
  description: |
    A path to a file, relative to the file in which the field is defined.

    The validation for this format is minimal.
    It simply ensures that the value is a string with any characters that may appear in a valid path,
    without starting with "/" (an absolute path).
  pattern: '(?!/)[0-9a-zA-Z/\_\-\.]+'
participant_relative:
  name: Path relative to the participant directory
  description: |
    A path to a file, relative to the participant's directory in the dataset.

    The validation for this format is minimal.
    It simply ensures that the value is a string with any characters that may appear in a valid path,
    without starting with "/" (an absolute path) or "sub/"
    (a relative path starting with the participant directory, rather than relative to that directory).
  pattern: '(?!/)(?!sub-)[0-9a-zA-Z/\_\-\.]+'
rrid:
  name: Research resource identifier
  description: |
    A [research resource identifier](https://scicrunch.org/resources).
  pattern: 'RRID:.+_.+'
stimuli_relative:
  name: Path relative to the stimuli directory
  description: |
    A path to a stimulus file, relative to a `/stimuli` directory somewhere.

    The validation for this format is minimal.
    It simply ensures that the value is a string with any characters that may appear in a valid path,
    without starting with "/" (an absolute path) or "stimuli/"
    (a relative path starting with the stimuli directory, rather than relative to that directory).
  pattern: '(?!/)(?!stimuli/)[0-9a-zA-Z/\_\-\.]+'
time:
  name: Time
  description: |
    A time in the form `"hh:mm:ss"`.
  pattern: '(?:2[0-3]|[01]?[0-9]):[0-5][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]'
unit:
  name: A standardized unit
  description: |
    A unit.
    SI units in CMIXF formatting are RECOMMENDED
    (see [Units](/02-common-principles.html#units)).

    Currently this matches any string.

    TODO: Somehow reference the actual unit options in the Units appendix.
  pattern: '.*'
uri:
  name: Uniform resource indicator
  description: |
    A uniform resource indicator.
  pattern: '(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?'
