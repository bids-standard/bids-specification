# This file defines valid patterns for different formats
# Entity patterns
index:
  display_name: Index
  description: |
    Non-negative, optionally prefixed with leading zeros for better visual homogeneity and sorting.
  pattern: '[0-9]+'
label:
  display_name: Label
  description: |
    Free-form labels with alphanumeric and plus (+) characters.

    Plus signs MAY be used to concatenate multiple applicable labels,
    but no relationship is established by a partial match.
    In particular, the inheritance principle does not connect files
    containing entities such as `<name>-x+y` with either `<name>-x` or `<name>-y`.
    For example, metadata stored in a file at the root of the dataset with name `/acq-6p_T2w.json`
    does not apply to files with partially matching "acquisition" entity values
    such as `/sub-1/anat/sub-1_acq-6p+s2_T2w.nii`.
  pattern: '[0-9a-zA-Z+]+'
# Metadata types
boolean:
  display_name: Boolean
  description: |
    A boolean.
    Must be either "true" or "false".
  pattern: '(true|false)'
integer:
  display_name: Integer
  description: |
    An integer which may be positive or negative.
  pattern: ' *[+-]?\d+ *'
number:
  display_name: Number
  description: |
    A number which may be an integer or float, positive or negative.
  pattern: ' *[+-]?([0-9]+([.][0-9]*)?|[.][0-9]+)([eE][+-]?[0-9]+)? *'
string:
  display_name: String
  description: |
    The basic string type (not a specific format).
    This should allow any free-form string.
  pattern: '.*'
# String formats
hed_version:
  display_name: HED Version
  description: |
    The version string of the used HED schema.
  pattern: "(?:[a-zA-Z]+:)?(?:[a-zA-Z]+_)?(?:0|[1-9][0-9]*)\\.(?:0|[1-9][0-9]*)\\.(?:0|[1-9][0-9]*)"
bids_uri:
  display_name: BIDS uniform resource indicator
  description: |
    A BIDS uniform resource indicator.

    The validation for this format is minimal.
    It simply ensures that the value is a string with any characters that may appear in a valid URI,
    starting with "bids:".
  pattern: 'bids:[0-9a-zA-Z/#:?_\-.]+'
dataset_relative:
  display_name: Path relative to the BIDS dataset directory
  description: |
    A path to a file, relative to the dataset directory.

    The validation for this format is minimal.
    It simply ensures that the value is a string with any characters that may appear in a valid path,
    without starting with "/" (an absolute path).
  pattern: '(?!/)[0-9a-zA-Z+/_\-.]+'
date:
  display_name: Date
  description: |
    A date in the form `"YYYY-MM-DD[Z]"`,
    where [Z] is an optional, valid timezone code.
  pattern: '[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}([A-Z]{2,4})?'
datetime:
  display_name: Datetime
  description: |
    An [RFC 3339](https://doi.org/10.17487/RFC3339) timestamp, with OPTIONAL time offset.
    Datetimes take the form `"YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[.000000][Z|+hh:mm|-hh:mm]"`,
    where `[.000000]` is an OPTIONAL subsecond resolution between 1 and 6 decimal points,
    and `[Z|+hh:mm|-hh:mm]` is a time offset.
    The character `Z` indicates Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),
    or else an integral number of minutes may be specified.

    For simplicity, this format validates RFC3339-invalid dates such as 2024-02-31,
    but implementations SHOULD error on non-existent dates and times.
  pattern: "\
    [0-9]{4}\
    -(?:0[1-9]|1[0-2])\
    -(?:0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])\
    T(?:2[0-3]|[01][0-9])\
    :[0-5][0-9]\
    :(?:[0-5][0-9]|60)\
    (?:\\.[0-9]{1,6})?\
    (?:Z|[+-](?:2[0-3]|[01][0-9]):[0-5][0-9])?"
file_relative:
  display_name: Path relative to the parent file
  description: |
    A path to a file, relative to the file in which the field is defined.

    The validation for this format is minimal.
    It simply ensures that the value is a string with any characters that may appear in a valid path,
    without starting with "/" (an absolute path).
  pattern: '(?!/)[0-9a-zA-Z+/_\-.]+'
participant_relative:
  display_name: Path relative to the participant directory
  description: |
    A path to a file, relative to the participant's directory in the dataset.

    The validation for this format is minimal.
    It simply ensures that the value is a string with any characters that may appear in a valid path,
    without starting with "/" (an absolute path) or "sub/"
    (a relative path starting with the participant directory, rather than relative to that directory).
  pattern: '(?!/)(?!sub-)[0-9a-zA-Z+/_\-.]+'
rrid:
  display_name: Research resource identifier
  description: |
    A [research resource identifier](https://rrid.site).
  pattern: 'RRID:.+_.+'
stimuli_relative:
  display_name: Path relative to the stimuli directory
  description: |
    A path to a stimulus file, relative to a `/stimuli` directory somewhere.

    The validation for this format is minimal.
    It simply ensures that the value is a string with any characters that may appear in a valid path,
    without starting with "/" (an absolute path) or "stimuli/"
    (a relative path starting with the stimuli directory, rather than relative to that directory).
  pattern: '(?!/)(?!stimuli/)[0-9a-zA-Z+/_\-.]+'
time:
  display_name: Time
  description: |
    A time in the form `"hh:mm:ss"`.
  pattern: '(?:2[0-3]|[01]?[0-9]):[0-5][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]'
unit:
  display_name: A standardized unit
  description: |
    A unit.
    SI units in CMIXF formatting are RECOMMENDED
    (see [Units](SPEC_ROOT/common-principles.md#units)).

    Currently this matches any string.

    TODO: Somehow reference the actual unit options in the Units appendix.
  pattern: '.*'
uri:
  display_name: Uniform resource indicator
  description: |
    A uniform resource indicator.
  pattern: '(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?'
