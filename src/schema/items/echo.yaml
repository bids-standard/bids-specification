  Multi-echo data MUST be split into one file per echo.
  Each file shares the same name with the exception of the `_echo-<index>`
  key/value.
  Please note that the `<index>` denotes the number/index (in the form of a
  nonnegative integer) of the echo not the echo time value which needs to be
  stored in the field `EchoTime` of the separate JSON file.
# Entity-specific fields
