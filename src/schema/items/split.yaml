  In the case of long data recordings that exceed a file size of 2Gb, the
  .fif files are conventionally split into multiple parts.
  Each of these files has an internal pointer to the next file.
  This is important when renaming these split recordings to the BIDS
  convention.

  Instead of a simple renaming, files should be read in and saved under their
  new names with dedicated tools like MNE, which will ensure that not only
  the file names, but also the internal file pointers will be updated.
  It is RECOMMENDED that .fif files with multiple parts use the
  `split-<index>` entity to indicate each part.
