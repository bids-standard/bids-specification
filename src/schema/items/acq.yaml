  The `acq-<label>` key/value pair corresponds to a custom label the
  user MAY use to distinguish a different set of parameters used for
  acquiring the same modality.
  For example this should be used when a study includes two T1w images - one
  full brain low resolution and and one restricted field of view but high
  resolution.
  In such case two files could have the following names:
  `sub-01_acq-highres_T1w.nii.gz` and `sub-01_acq-lowres_T1w.nii.gz`, however
  the user is free to choose any other label than highres and lowres as long
  as they are consistent across subjects and sessions.
  In case different sequences are used to record the same modality (e.g. RARE
  and FLASH for T1w) this field can also be used to make that distinction.
  At what level of detail to make the distinction (e.g. just between RARE and
  FLASH, or between RARE, FLASH, and FLASHsubsampled) remains at the
  discretion of the researcher.
