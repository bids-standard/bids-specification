sub:
  name: Subject
  description: |
    A person or animal participating in the study.
  format: label
ses:
  name: Session
  description: |
    A logical grouping of neuroimaging and behavioral data consistent across
    subjects.
    Session can (but doesn't have to) be synonymous to a visit in a
    longitudinal study.
    In general, subjects will stay in the scanner during one session.
    However, for example, if a subject has to leave the scanner room and then
    be re-positioned on the scanner bed, the set of MRI acquisitions will still
    be considered as a session and match sessions acquired in other subjects.
    Similarly, in situations where different data types are obtained over
    several visits (for example fMRI on one day followed by DWI the day after)
    those can be grouped in one session.
    Defining multiple sessions is appropriate when several identical or similar
    data acquisitions are planned and performed on all -or most- subjects,
    often in the case of some intervention between sessions (e.g., training).
  format: label
task:
  name: Task
  format: label
  description: |
    Each task has a unique label that MUST only consist of letters and/or
    numbers (other characters, including spaces and underscores, are not
    allowed).
    Those labels MUST be consistent across subjects and sessions.
acq:
  name: Acquisition
  description: |
    The OPTIONAL acq-<label> key/value pair corresponds to a custom label the
    user MAY use to distinguish a different set of parameters used for
    acquiring the same modality.
    For example this should be used when a study includes two T1w images - one
    full brain low resolution and and one restricted field of view but high
    resolution.
    In such case two files could have the following names:
    sub-01_acq-highres_T1w.nii.gz and sub-01_acq-lowres_T1w.nii.gz, however the
    user is free to choose any other label than highres and lowres as long as
    they are consistent across subjects and sessions.
    In case different sequences are used to record the same modality (e.g. RARE
    and FLASH for T1w) this field can also be used to make that distinction.
    At what level of detail to make the distinction (e.g. just between RARE and
    FLASH, or between RARE, FLASH, and FLASHsubsampled) remains at the
    discretion of the researcher.
  format: label
ce:
  name: Contrast Enhancing Agent
  description: |
    Similarly the OPTIONAL ce-<label> key/value can be used to distinguish
    sequences using different contrast enhanced images.
    The label is the name of the contrast agent.
    The key ContrastBolusIngredient MAY be also be added in the JSON file, with
    the same label.
  format: label
rec:
  name: Reconstruction
  description: |
    Similarly the OPTIONAL rec-<label> key/value can be used to distinguish
    different reconstruction algorithms (for example ones using motion
    correction).
  format: label
dir:
  name: Phase-Encoding Direction
  description: |
    Similarly the OPTIONAL dir-<label> key/value can be used to distinguish
    different phase-encoding directions.
  format: label
run:
  name: Run
  description: |
    If several scans of the same modality are acquired they MUST be indexed
    with a key-value pair: `_run-1`, `_run-2`, `_run-3` etc. (only integers
    are allowed as run labels).
    When there is only one scan of a given type the run key MAY be omitted.
    Please note that diffusion imaging data is stored elsewhere (see below).
  format: index
mod:
  name: Corresponding Modality
  description: |
    In such cases the OPTIONAL `mod-<label>` key/value pair corresponds to
    modality label for eg: T1w, inplaneT1, referenced by a defacemask image.
    E.g., sub-01_mod-T1w_defacemask.nii.gz.
  format: label
echo:
  name: Echo
  description: |
    Multi-echo data MUST be split into one file per echo.
    Each file shares the same name with the exception of the `_echo-<index>`
    key/value.
  format: index
recording:
  name: Recording
  description: |
    More than one continuous recording file can be included (with different
    sampling frequencies).
    In such case use different labels.
    For example: `_recording-contrast`, `_recording-saturation`.
  format: label
proc:
  name: Processed (on device)
  description: |
    The proc label is analogous to rec for MR and denotes a variant of a file
    that was a result of particular processing performed on the device.
    This is useful for files produced in particular by Elektaâ€™s MaxFilter
    (e.g. sss, tsss, trans, quat, mc, etc.), which some installations impose to
    be run on raw data because of active shielding software corrections before
    the MEG data can actually be exploited.
  format: label
space:
  name: Space
  description: |
    The optional space label (`*[_space-<label>]_electrodes.tsv`) can be used
    to indicate the way in which electrode positions are interpreted.
    The space label needs to be taken from the list in Appendix VIII.
  format: label
split:
  name: Split
  description: |
    In the case of long data recordings that exceed a file size of 2Gb, the
    .fif files are conventionally split into multiple parts.
    Each of these files has an internal pointer to the next file.
    This is important when renaming these split recordings to the BIDS
    convention.
    Instead of a simple renaming, files should be read in and saved under their
    new names with dedicated tools like MNE, which will ensure that not only
    the file names, but also the internal file pointers will be updated.
    It is RECOMMENDED that .fif files with multiple parts use the
    `split-<index>` entity to indicate each part.
