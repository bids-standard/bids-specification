name: Magnetization Transfer
entity: mt
description: |
  If files belonging to an entity-linked file collection are acquired at different
  magnetization transfer (MT) states, the `_mt-<label>` key/value pair MUST be used to
  distinguish individual files.
  This entity represents the `MTState` metadata field. Allowed label values for this
  entity are `on` and `off`, for images acquired in presence and absence of an MT pulse,
  respectively.
type: string
# on/off map to True/False in YAML so they must be placed in quotes.
enum:
  - "on"
  - "off"
