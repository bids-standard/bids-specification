description: |
  If files belonging to an entity-linked file collection are acquired at different
  inversion times, the `_inv-<index>` key/value pair MUST be used to distinguish
  individual files.
  This entity represents the `InversionTime` metadata field. Please note that the `<index>`
  denotes the number/index (in the form of a nonnegative integer), not the `InversionTime`
  value which needs to be stored in the field `InversionTime` of the separate JSON file.
