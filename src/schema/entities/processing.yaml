description: |
  The proc label is analogous to rec for MR and denotes a variant of a file
  that was a result of particular processing performed on the device.
  This is useful for files produced in particular by Elektaâ€™s MaxFilter
  (for example, sss, tsss, trans, quat or mc),
  which some installations impose to be run on raw data because of active
  shielding software corrections before the MEG data can actually be
  exploited.
