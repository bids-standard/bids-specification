name: Part
entity: part
description: |
  This entity is used to indicate which component of the complex
  representation of the MRI signal is represented in voxel data.
  The `part-<label>` key/value pair is associated with the DICOM Tag
  `0008, 9208`.
  Allowed label values for this entity are `phase`, `mag`, `real` and `imag`,
  which are typically used in `part-mag`/`part-phase` or
  `part-real`/`part-imag` pairs of files.

  Phase images MAY be in radians or in arbitrary units.
  The sidecar JSON file MUST include the units of the `phase` image.
  The possible options are `rad` or `arbitrary`.

  When there is only a magnitude image of a given type, the `part` key MAY be
  omitted.
type: string
