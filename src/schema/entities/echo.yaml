description: |
  If files belonging to an entity-linked file collection are acquired at different
  echo times, the `_echo-<index>` key/value pair MUST be used to distinguish
  individual files.
  This entity represents the `EchoTime` metadata field. Please note that the `<index>`
  denotes the number/index (in the form of a nonnegative integer), not the
  `EchoTime` value which needs to be stored in the field `EchoTime` of the separate
  JSON file.
