  In the case of long data recordings that exceed a file size of 2Gb, the
  .fif files are conventionally split into multiple parts.
  Each of these files has an internal pointer to the next file.
  This is important when renaming these split recordings to the BIDS
  convention.

  Instead of a simple renaming, files should be read in and saved under their
  new names with dedicated tools like [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/),
  which will ensure that not only the file names, but also the internal file
  pointers will be updated.
  It is RECOMMENDED that .fif files with multiple parts use the
  `split-<index>` entity to indicate each part.
  If there are multiple parts of a recording and the optional `scans.tsv` is provided,
  remember to list all files separately in `scans.tsv` and that the entries for the
  `acq_time` column in `scans.tsv` MUST all be identical, as described in
  [Scans file](../03-modality-agnostic-files.md#scans-file).
