# Execute this script from anywhere in the repository to push to a new unique testing tag.
# This is a script which automates creation and pushing of unique tags for github actions.
# It is particularly useful when debugging the upload hooks for pypi.
# The workflow for that is to edit `.github/workflows/schemacode_ci.yml` and add a secondary branch name to the `on` section right after master.
# This will allow you to keep pushing to the branch as if it were master and unix-time tagged archives being uploaded to test.pypi.
