    This class wraps :mod:`importlib.resources` to provide a getter
    function with an interpreter-lifetime scope. For typical packages
    it simply passes through filesystem paths as :class:`~pathlib.Path`
    objects. For zipped distributions, it will unpack the files into
    a temporary directory that is cleaned up on interpreter exit.

    This loader accepts a fully-qualified module name or a module
    object.

    :class:`~Loader` objects implement the :func:`callable` interface
    and generate a docstring, and are intended to be treated and documented
    as functions.
