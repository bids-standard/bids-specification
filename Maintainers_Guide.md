# BIDS Maintainers Group guide

The BIDS Maintainers are a key group of members that ensure the BIDS infrastructure is kept up.
This group has wide-ranging responsibilities that enables BIDS to continue to grow and succeed.

## Responsibilities

The primary responsible of a maintainer is ensuring the infrastructure that the BIDS community uses is handled and kept up to date.
Here we list several examples of common responsibilities for a BIDS maintainer.
Please note that one maintainer need not do all of these tasks.
They may be spread across the team according to the initiative of each maintainer and/or the direction of the lead maintainer.

* Triaging issues and PRs then notifying appropriate reviewers in a timely manner
* Facilitating discussions
* Ensuring the Contributors list is up to date and assisting contributors with adding their credits
     * Perform community inquiries to ensure contributors are credited in the [Contributors appendix](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/99-appendices/01-contributors.html)
     * Verify contributing members (e.g., author of a pull request) are also identified in the [Contributors appendix](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/99-appendices/01-contributors.html)
     * Ultimately, what constitutes a contribution is left to the discretion of the maintainers
* Assisting with voting and elections
* Proposing and implementing enhancements to the infrastructure

Maintainers service time will be agreed upon between the lead maintainer and the interested maintainer.
Maintainers will be reviewed every 3 - 6 months.
This will be determined on a case by case basis at the discretion of the lead maintainer.
There is no limit to the number of appointments a member may obtain.

## Admission process

Upon a successful review, the Contributors group will vote to finalize the appointment.
A successful vote will have at least 20% of the Contributors voted with the result based on a majority decision.
Only the initial appointment needs a vote.
