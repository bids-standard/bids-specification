The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is an emerging standard for the
organisation of neuroimaging data.

In this repository, we develop the
[BIDS specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

If you want to become a part of the BIDS community and contribute to the specification, please see our
[contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
