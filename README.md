The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is an emerging standard for the
organisation of neuroimaging data.

In this repository, we develop the
[BIDS specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Contributing to BIDS

BIDS is a community-driven standard and it depends on contributions from its
users. We have ongoing discussions about a broad variety of topics, reaching
from details about the implementation of certain key-value fields in highly
specialized files up to broad and impactful decisions on how we want to thrive
as a community.

All discussions are happening in the following channels:

- The [GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues)
  - Watch out for the pinned issues on top of the issues page. The following
    tags help you to access the most important issues:
    [`help wanted`](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/labels/help%20wanted),
    [`community input needed`](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/labels/community),
    and [`opinions wanted`](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/labels/opinions%20wanted)
- The [bids-discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bids-discussion)
  Google Group
  - Note that this is largely deprecated, but a small amount of traffic remains.
- The [NeuroStars](https://neurostars.org/tags/bids) Discourse Forum, under the
  `bids` tag
  - Keep on top of new posts by setting your [topic notifications](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-new-user-guide/96331#heading--topic-notifications)
