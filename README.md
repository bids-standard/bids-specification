The [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io) is an emerging standard for the
organisation of neuroimaging data.

In this repository, we develop the
[BIDS specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# When to use BIDS

To organize your data in BIDS, all you need is neuro data, a computer, and the
[BIDS specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

BIDS currently supports MRI, MEG, EEG, iEEG, behavioral, and physiological data
and more modalities will be added.

# Formatting your data with BIDS

As a dataset curator, the GitHub repository and all files therein can be safely ignored.
Users should focus on [the rendered content](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
The specification is provided in the form of a webpage, built using
[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

*Want to learn more about working with BIDS? Have a question, comment, or suggestion?*

1. Read some introductory material, most likely the very basic problems have already been addressed!
  - [BIDS Starter Kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit) for tutorials, wikis, templates, ...
2. Post your question in one of several channels where BIDS members are active
  - the [NeuroStars](https://neurostars.org/tags/bids) discourse forum
  - the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bids-discussion), for broader discussions surrounding BIDS
  - the [specification repository issue page](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues), if you found inconsistencies, typos, or other issues with the BIDS specification itself
