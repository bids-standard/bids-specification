# pdf-version of BIDS specification

The `pdf_build_src` directory contains the scripts and `.tex` files required to build a pdf document of the BIDS specification from multiple markdown files using the pandoc library.

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html) is command line tool which is also a Haskell library that converts files from one markup format to another.

## Requirements

For the pdf build to be successful, the following need to be installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Numpy
- pandoc
- Latest version of LaTeX: By default, Pandoc creates PDFs using LaTeX.
  Because a full MacTeX installation uses four gigabytes of disk space,
  pandoc recommends BasicTeX or TinyTeX and using the tlmgr tool to install additional packages as needed.
- The [Symbola font](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=fonts-symbola) that provides all emoji unicodes necessary to render the contributor icons in the PDF

Installation instructions for both pandoc and LaTeX: https://pandoc.org/installing.html

## Building pdf document

Run the `build_pdf.sh` from the `pdf_build_src` with the command `sh build_pdf.sh` from the command line terminal

## Technical Overview

Pandoc comes with a plethora of options to format the resulting document.
For building a pdf from multiple markdowns, a consolidated intermediate tex file is first built,
which is then converted to a pdf document.
To achieve the desired formatting in the final pdf,
additional tex files are used with options offered by pandoc.

### Formatting files

- `metadata.yml` - Contains formatting options for the PDF.

- `header_setup.tex` -  This file sets up the packages to suit our needs.

- `cover.tex` - BIDS Logo is used as a cover page for the document. `cover.tex` is used with the option `--include-before-body`

- `header.tex` - Header tex file that's updated with the latest version number and date when `build_pdf.sh` is run. Used with the `-include-in-header` (or `-H`) option.

### Scripts

- `process_markdowns.py` - Script that processes markdown files in the `src` directory that are duplicated and modified for the needs of the pdf.

- `pandoc_script.py` - Prepares and runs the final pandoc command through the `build_pdf.sh` script

- `build_pdf.sh` - Shell script that organizes the directory structure and runs the above two python scripts
